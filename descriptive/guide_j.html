        <h1>Descriptive Statistics in jamovi</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">A Guide to Understanding and Summarizing Data</p>

        <p>This guide will walk you through the process of obtaining summary statistics and creating relevant graphs for different types of variables using jamovi. Understanding descriptive statistics is a foundational skill in data analysis, providing essential insights into the characteristics of your dataset.</p>

        <p>Descriptive statistics help us understand the basic features of the data in a study. They provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures, forming the basis of virtually every quantitative analysis.</p>

        <p>Before you begin, ensure you have your <code>omni.omv</code> file open in jamovi. Throughout this guide, we will use specific variables from your dataset to illustrate the concepts. You will also be prompted to apply the steps to other relevant variables:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>final_exam_score</code>: Represents the numerical score achieved by students on a final exam.</li>
            <li><code>study_hours_per_week</code>: Indicates the number of hours a student reported studying each week.</li>
            <li><code>preferred_study_method</code>: Describes a student's chosen study strategy (e.g., 'Summarizing', 'Practice Tests', 'Flashcards').</li>
            <li><code>study_session_group</code>: A categorical variable indicating the type of study session group a student was assigned to (e.g., 'High', 'Medium', 'Low').</li>
            <li><code>used_study_support_services</code>: A categorical variable indicating whether a student utilized study support services (Yes/No). This variable will be used to demonstrate splitting analyses by groups.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>Part 1: Analyzing Interval/Ratio Variables</h2>
        <p>Interval/ratio variables are numerical variables where the differences between values are meaningful. For example, a 10-point difference in exam scores means the same regardless of the score range. Ratio variables also have a true zero point (e.g., age, income, test scores, study hours), where zero indicates an absence of the quantity. For these types of variables, we typically examine measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (standard deviation, variance, range).</p>

        <h3>1.1 Obtaining Summary Statistics for Interval/Ratio Variables (e.g., final_exam_score)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Open your <code>omni.omv</code> file in jamovi.</li>
            <li>In the jamovi ribbon at the top, click on the <code>Analyses</code> tab.</li>
            <li>Go to <code>Exploration</code> and select <code>Descriptives</code>.</li>
            <li><p>A new window will appear. On the left, you'll see a list of all variables in your dataset. Find <code>final_exam_score</code> and move it to the <code>Variables</code> box on the right using the arrow button.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p>Under the <code>Statistics</code> section (usually open by default or can be expanded), ensure the following checkboxes are selected:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><code>N</code> (Number of valid cases)</li>
                    <li><code>Missing</code> (Number of missing values)</li>
                    <li><code>Mean</code></li>
                    <li><code>Median</code></li>
                    <li><code>Mode</code></li>
                    <li><code>Standard deviation</code></li>
                    <li><code>Variance</code></li>
                    <li><code>Minimum</code></li>
                    <li><code>Maximum</code></li>
                    <li><code>Skewness</code></li>
                    <li><code>Kurtosis</code></li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>As you select these options, jamovi will automatically generate the results table in the output panel on the right.</li>
        </ol>

        <h3>1.2 Interpreting Summary Statistics for Interval/Ratio Variables</h3>
        <p>Here's what each statistic tells us:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>N &amp; Missing:</strong> The total number of valid observations (N) and the count of any missing data points for this variable.</li>
            <li><strong>Mean:</strong> The arithmetic average of all values. It is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of observations. The mean is sensitive to extreme values (outliers), meaning it can be pulled towards very high or very low scores.</li>
            <li><strong>Median:</strong> The middle value when data is ordered from smallest to largest. If there's an even number of observations, it's the average of the two middle values. The median is less affected by outliers than the mean, making it a good measure of typical value in skewed distributions.</li>
            <li><strong>Mode:</strong> The value that appears most frequently in the dataset. A dataset can have one mode, multiple modes (bimodal or multimodal), or no mode if all values occur with the same frequency.</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Deviation:</strong> A measure of the typical distance data points are from the mean. A smaller standard deviation indicates data points are clustered closely around the mean, while a larger one indicates more spread or variability in the data.</li>
            <li><strong>Variance:</strong> The average of the squared differences from the Mean. It is the square of the standard deviation. It gives a numerical value describing the spread of data points.</li>
            <li><strong>Minimum &amp; Maximum:</strong> The smallest and largest values observed in your dataset for that variable. This gives you the range of your data.</li>
            <li><strong>Skewness:</strong> Indicates the symmetry of the distribution.
                <ul>
                    <li>If <strong>Skewness is close to 0</strong>, the distribution is relatively symmetrical (e.g., a bell curve). In symmetrical distributions, the mean, median, and mode are often very close to each other.</li>
                    <li>If <strong>Skewness is positive (>0)</strong>, the tail of the distribution extends to the right (positive direction). This typically means there are more lower values, with a few higher, extreme values pulling the mean to the right of the median. In this case, the Mean > Median.</li>
                    <li>If <strong>Skewness is negative (<0)</strong>, the tail extends to the left (negative direction). This typically means there are more higher values, with a few lower, extreme values pulling the mean to the left of the median. In this case, the Mean < Median.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Kurtosis:</strong> Indicates the "tailedness" or peakedness of the distribution compared to a normal distribution.
                <ul>
                    <li>If <strong>Kurtosis is positive (>0)</strong> (leptokurtic), it suggests heavier tails and a more peaked distribution, potentially indicating more outliers (extreme values).</li>
                    <li>If <strong>Kurtosis is negative (<0)</strong> (platykurtic), it suggests lighter tails and a flatter distribution, with fewer extreme values than a normal distribution.</li>
                    <li>If <strong>Kurtosis is close to 0</strong> (mesokurtic), it resembles the tailedness and peakedness of a normal distribution.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.3 Creating Graphs for Interval/Ratio Variables (Histograms & Box Plots)</h3>
        <p>Graphs provide powerful visual insights into the distribution of your data, complementing the numerical summaries.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Continuing from the <code>Descriptives</code> analysis window, look for the <code>Plots</code> section.</li>
            <li>Select <code>Histogram</code> and <code>Box plot</code>.</li>
            <li><p>Jamovi will automatically update the output panel with these plots.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>1.4 Interpreting Graphs for Interval/Ratio Variables</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Histogram:</strong> Displays the shape of the distribution, showing where values are concentrated, identifying peaks (modes), gaps, and overall symmetry or skewness. Each bar represents a range of values (or "bin"), and its height shows the frequency of scores within that range.</li>
            <li><strong>Box Plot:</strong> Provides a clear visual representation of the "five-number summary": minimum, first quartile (Q1), median (Q2), third quartile (Q3), and maximum. It is particularly effective for identifying outliers.
                <ul>
                    <li>The box itself represents the <strong>Interquartile Range (IQR)</strong>, which contains the middle 50% of your data (between Q1 and Q3).</li>
                    <li>The line inside the box is the <strong>median</strong>.</li>
                    <li>The "whiskers" typically extend to the most extreme data points within 1.5 times the IQR from the box.</li>
                    <li>Individual points (often shown as dots or asterisks) beyond the whiskers are considered <strong>outliers</strong>, specifically those falling more than 1.5 times the IQR below Q1 or above Q3. These points represent values unusually far from the rest of the data.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="reflection-question">
            <h4>Reflection Questions & Tasks:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>For the final exam scores, compare the Mean (74.71) and Median (75.00). Based on the explanation of skewness in Section 1.2, what does the relationship between these two values suggest about the symmetry of the final exam score distribution?</li>
                <li>Consider the Skewness value (0.00) and Kurtosis value (-0.13) for the final exam scores. How do these numerical values, along with the visual information from the histogram, help you describe the overall shape of this distribution? Is it symmetrical, and does it appear peaked or relatively flat compared to a typical bell curve?</li>
                <li>Examine the box plot for the final exam scores. Do you see any individual points plotted outside the main "whiskers" of the box plot? If so, what do these points represent in the context of our data?</li>

                <li>For the final exam scores, the Mean (74.71) and Median (75.00) are very close. This indicates that the distribution of final exam scores is quite <strong>symmetrical</strong>, as neither the mean nor the median is significantly pulled in one direction by extreme values.</li>
                <li>The Skewness value of 0.00 suggests that the distribution of final exam scores is almost perfectly symmetrical. A Kurtosis value of -0.13, which is close to 0 but slightly negative, indicates that the distribution is slightly <strong>platykurtic</strong> (a bit flatter than a normal distribution), meaning it has slightly lighter tails and fewer extreme values. The histogram should visually confirm this: a roughly bell-shaped curve with no pronounced long tail on either side.</li>
                <li>For the final exam scores, the box plot <strong>does show one individual point</strong> beyond the top whisker. This signifies that there is one statistical <strong>outlier</strong> detected in this dataset for final exam scores, based on the 1.5 IQR rule. This point represents an unusually high score compared to the majority of the data.</li>

            <p>To describe the distribution of final exam scores, descriptive statistics were computed. The sample consisted of N = 100 participants. The mean final exam score was 74.71 (SD = 5.76), with scores ranging from a minimum of 60 to a maximum of 89. The median score was 75.00. The distribution of final exam scores appeared highly symmetrical with a slightly light-tailed distribution, as indicated by the skewness (0.00) and kurtosis (-0.13) values, respectively. A histogram and box plot further illustrate these characteristics, showing a unimodal distribution with one apparent outlier.</p>

        <h2>Part 2: Analyzing Categorical Variables</h2>
        <p>Categorical variables represent types of data which can be divided into groups or categories. This includes nominal variables (categories without inherent order, e.g., 'preferred study method', where 'Flashcards' is not "better" or "more" than 'Summarizing') and ordinal variables (categories with a meaningful order, e.g., satisfaction ratings like 'Low', 'Medium', 'High'). For categorical variables, we focus on frequencies and proportions rather than means and standard deviations, as these mathematical operations are not meaningful for non-numerical categories.</p>

        <h3>2.1 Obtaining Frequency Tables for Categorical Variables (e.g., preferred_study_method)</h3>
        <ol>

                <li>We avoid calculating a "mean" or "standard deviation" for 'preferred study method' because it is a <strong>nominal categorical variable</strong>. Its categories ("Flashcards", "Summarizing", "Practice Tests") are simply labels; they do not represent quantities or have a numerical order.

        <h2>Part 3: Descriptive Statistics by Groups (Splitting Data by Factors)</h2>
        <p>In data analysis, it is often insightful to understand if a numerical variable's distribution differs across distinct categories of another variable. This is known as "splitting" or "grouping" your data. For example, we might want to see if the final exam scores vary between students who used study support services and those who did not.</p>

        <h3>3.1 Analyzing Interval/Ratio Variable by a Categorical Factor (e.g., final exam scores by used_study_support_services)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Return to the <code>Analyses</code> tab, then <code>Exploration</code> &gt; <code>Descriptives</code>.</li>
            <li>Move <code>final_exam_score</code> to the <code>Variables</code> box.</li>
            <li>Now, find the categorical variable <code>used_study_support_services</code> and move it to the <code>Split By</code> box. This action tells jamovi to calculate descriptive statistics for final exam scores separately for each group (i.e., 'Yes' and 'No' groups) within `used_study_support_services`.</li>
            <li><p>Ensure that all relevant statistics (Mean, Median, Std Dev, Min, Max, Skewness, Kurtosis) are selected under the <code>Statistics</code> panel, and both <code>Histogram</code> and <code>Box plot</code> are selected under the <code>Plots</code> panel.</p>
                <p>You will now observe jamovi generating separate results tables and plots for the 'No' and 'Yes' categories of <code>used_study_support_services</code> in your output panel.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>3.2 Interpreting Grouped Descriptive Statistics</h3>
        <p>By comparing the statistics and plots for each group, you can identify differences in the central tendency, spread, and shape of the numerical variable's distribution across your defined categories.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comparison of Means/Medians:</strong> Observe if the average exam scores are different for students who used support services compared to those who did not.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparison of Standard Deviations:</strong> Determine if the variability (consistency) in exam scores is different between the two groups. A larger standard deviation suggests more diverse scores within that group.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparison of Skewness/Kurtosis:</strong> Analyze if the shapes of the exam score distributions differ between the 'Yes' and 'No' groups (e.g., is one group's scores more skewed or more peaked?).</li>
            <li><strong>Box Plots:</strong> Visually compare the median lines, the size of the boxes (IQR), and the presence or absence of outliers between the groups. This provides a quick visual summary of potential group differences.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="reflection-question">
            <h4>Reflection Questions & Tasks:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Based on the grouped descriptive statistics for final exam scores when split by <code>used_study_support_services</code>, what is the mean final exam score for students who used support services compared to those who did not? What initial conclusion can you draw from this difference?</li>
                <li>Examine the standard deviations for both groups: 'Yes' (4.77) and 'No' (5.84). What does this difference imply about the consistency or variability of final exam scores within each group?</li>
                <li>Look closely at the grouped histograms or box plots. Do the distributions of final exam scores appear to have similar shapes (e.g., symmetry, spread, presence of outliers) for both groups, or are there noticeable visual differences that stand out?</li>
                <li><strong>Task:</strong> Conduct a similar analysis. Explore the numerical variable <code>quiz_score_post</code>, but this time, split it by the categorical variable <code>attended_peer_study_group</code>. What patterns do you observe regarding their post-quiz scores?</li>

            <h4>Suggested Solutions for Reflection Questions (Part 3):</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>The mean final exam score for students who used study support services is 76.90, which is higher than the mean of 72.33 for students who did not use support services. This suggests that, in this sample, students who utilized study support services tended to achieve higher final exam scores, on average.</li>
                <li>The standard deviation for the 'Yes' group (4.77) is smaller than for the 'No' group (5.84). This implies that final exam scores among students who used study support services were generally <strong>more consistent</strong> (less spread out) compared to those who did not use study support services. The scores in the 'Yes' group were more clustered around their mean.</li>
                <li>For final exam scores split by <code>used_study_support_services</code>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>'No' Group:</strong> N=48, Mean=72.33, Median=72.00, StdDev=5.84, Min=60, Max=89, Skewness=0.31, Kurtosis=0.31. Mode: [68, 69, 71, 78] (multimodal).</li>
                        <li><strong>'Yes' Group:</strong> N=52, Mean=76.90, Median=76.00, StdDev=4.77, Min=68, Max=87, Skewness=0.20, Kurtosis=-0.56. Mode: [76].</li>
                    </ul>
                    Visually, the box plots will show that the 'Yes' group's distribution is centered at a higher score and its box (IQR) is narrower, indicating less variability. Both distributions appear relatively symmetrical, but the 'Yes' group might appear slightly flatter (more platykurtic) in its histogram, while the 'No' group is slightly more peaked.</li>
                <li><strong>Task Solution (for <code>quiz_score_post</code> split by <code>attended_peer_study_group</code>):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Students who DID NOT attend peer study group ('No' group):</strong> N=47, Mean=71.3, Median=71, SD=8.63, Minimum=50, Maximum=88, Skewness=-0.311, Kurtosis=-0.0276.</li>
                        <li><strong>Students who DID attend peer study group ('Yes' group):</strong> N=53, Mean=70.8, Median=71, SD=10.62, Minimum=49, Maximum=95, Skewness=-0.148, Kurtosis=-0.3650.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Based on these numbers, students who attended peer study groups ('Yes' group) had a slightly lower mean post-quiz score (70.8) compared to those who did not attend ('No' group, 71.3). The 'Yes' group also shows a larger standard deviation (10.62 vs 8.63), indicating more variability in their post-quiz scores. Both distributions appear slightly negatively skewed and slightly platykurtic. This suggests that in this sample, attending peer study groups did not lead to higher average post-quiz scores and was associated with more varied performance.

            <h4>Write-Up Template for Grouped Interval/Ratio Variable (Example)</h4>
            <p>To compare final exam performance based on study support service usage, descriptive statistics for final exam scores were computed, split by study support service usage. Students who reported using study support services (N = 52) had a mean final exam score of 76.90 (SD = 4.77), a median of 76.00, and scores ranging from 68 to 87. In contrast, students who did not use study support services (N = 48) had a mean final exam score of 72.33 (SD = 5.84), a median of 72.00, and scores ranging from 60 to 89. This suggests that students utilizing support services achieved, on average, higher and more consistent final exam scores. Further visual inspection of the grouped histograms and box plots provides additional insights into the distributions of scores for both groups. For instance, the 'Yes' group's distribution appears slightly narrower and centered at a higher score, with less variability than the 'No' group. Both distributions were relatively symmetrical, with the 'No' group having a skewness of 0.31 and kurtosis of 0.31, while the 'Yes' group had a skewness of 0.20 and kurtosis = -0.56.</p>
