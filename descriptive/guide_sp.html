        <h1>Descriptive Statistics in SPSS</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">A Guide to Understanding and Summarising Data using SPSS</p>

        <p>This guide will walk you through the process of obtaining summary statistics and creating relevant graphs for different types of variables using SPSS. Understanding descriptive statistics is a foundational skill in data analysis, providing essential insights into the characteristics of your dataset.</p>

        <p>Descriptive statistics help us understand the basic features of the data in a study. They provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures, forming the basis of virtually every quantitative analysis.</p>

        <p>Before you begin, ensure you have your <code>omni.sav</code> file available and open in SPSS. Throughout this guide, we will use specific variables from your dataset to illustrate the concepts. You will also be prompted to apply the steps to other relevant variables:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>final_exam_score</code>: Represents the numerical score achieved by students on a final exam.</li>
            <li><code>study_hours_per_week</code>: Indicates the number of hours a student reported studying each week.</li>
            <li><code>preferred_study_method</code>: Describes a student's chosen study strategy (e.g., 'Flashcards', 'Summarising', 'Practice Tests'). This variable will have already been converted to a numerical nominal format with value labels attached.</li>
            <li><code>study_session_group</code>: A categorical variable indicating the type of study session group a student was assigned to (e.g., 'High', 'Medium', 'Low'). This variable will also have already been converted to a numerical nominal format with value labels attached.</li>
            <li><code>used_study_support_services</code>: A categorical variable indicating whether a student utilised study support services (Yes/No). This variable will be used to demonstrate splitting analyses by groups, and will also have been converted to a numerical nominal format.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To open your data in SPSS:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Launch SPSS Statistics.</li>
            <li>Go to <code>File > Open > Data...</code></li>
            <li>Navigate to where your <code>omni.sav</code> file is saved, select it, and click <code>Open</code>.</li>
        </ol>

        <hr>

        <h2>Part 1: Analysing Interval/Ratio Variables</h2>
        <p>Interval/ratio variables are numerical variables where the differences between values are meaningful. For example, a 10-point difference in exam scores means the same regardless of the score range. Ratio variables also have a true zero point (e.g., age, income, test scores, study hours), where zero indicates an absence of the quantity. For these types of variables, we typically examine measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (standard deviation, variance, range).</p>

        <h3>1.1 Obtaining Summary Statistics for Interval/Ratio Variables (e.g., final_exam_score)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>With your <code>omni.sav</code> file open in SPSS, go to the menu bar: <code>Analyse > Descriptive Statistics > Frequencies...</code></li>
            <li>A new dialog box will appear. In the left-hand list, find your numerical variable (e.g., <code>final_exam_score</code>) and move it to the <code>Variables(s):</code> box on the right using the arrow button.</li>
            <li>By default, SPSS will generate a frequency table, which is generally not useful for continuous numerical data. You can uncheck <code>Display frequency tables</code> at the bottom-left of the dialog box.</li>
            <li><p>Click on the <code>Statistics...</code> button to open the Frequencies: Statistics dialog box. Here, you will select the statistics you wish to compute:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>Under <strong>Central Tendency</strong>, select: <code>Mean</code>, <code>Median</code>, <code>Mode</code>.</li>
                    <li>Under <strong>Dispersion</strong>, select: <code>Std. deviation</code>, <code>Variance</code>, <code>Minimum</code>, <code>Maximum</code>.</li>
                    <li>Under <strong>Distribution</strong>, select: <code>Skewness</code>, <code>Kurtosis</code>.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Click <code>Continue</code> to close the Statistics dialog box, then click <code>OK</code> in the main Frequencies dialog box.</li>
            <p>SPSS will now open an Output Viewer window displaying the requested descriptive statistics in a table.</p>
        </ol>

        <h3>1.2 Interpreting Summary Statistics for Interval/Ratio Variables</h3>
        <p>Here's what each statistic tells us:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>N (Valid & Missing):</strong> The total number of valid observations for the variable and the count of any missing data points.</li>
            <li><strong>Mean:</strong> The arithmetic average of all values. It is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of observations. The mean is sensitive to extreme values (outliers), meaning it can be pulled towards very high or very low scores.</li>
            <li><strong>Median:</strong> The middle value when data is ordered from smallest to largest. If there's an even number of observations, it's the average of the two middle values. The median is less affected by outliers than the mean, making it a good measure of typical value in skewed distributions.</li>
            <li><strong>Mode:</strong> The value that appears most frequently in the dataset. A dataset can have one mode, multiple modes (bimodal or multimodal), or no mode if all values occur with the same frequency. SPSS will list all modes if there are multiple.</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Deviation:</strong> A measure of the typical distance data points are from the mean. A smaller standard deviation indicates data points are clustered closely around the mean, while a larger one indicates more spread or variability in the data.</li>
            <li><strong>Variance:</strong> The average of the squared differences from the Mean. It is the square of the standard deviation. It gives a numerical value describing the spread of data points.</li>
            <li><strong>Minimum &amp; Maximum:</strong> The smallest and largest values observed in your dataset for that variable. This gives you the range of your data.</li>
            <li><strong>Skewness:</strong> Indicates the symmetry of the distribution.
                <ul>
                    <li>If **Skewness is close to 0**, the distribution is relatively symmetrical (e.g., a bell curve). In symmetrical distributions, the mean, median, and mode are often very close to each other.</li>
                    <li>If **Skewness is positive (>0)**, the tail of the distribution extends to the right (positive direction). This typically means there are more lower values, with a few higher, extreme values pulling the mean to the right of the median. In this case, the Mean > Median.</li>
                    <li>If **Skewness is negative (<0)**, the tail extends to the left (negative direction). This typically means there are more higher values, with a few lower, extreme values pulling the mean to the left of the median. In this case, the Mean < Median.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Kurtosis:</strong> Indicates the "tailedness" or peakedness of the distribution compared to a normal distribution.
                <ul>
                    <li>If **Kurtosis is positive (>0)** (leptokurtic), it suggests heavier tails and a more peaked distribution, potentially indicating more outliers (extreme values).</li>
                    <li>If **Kurtosis is negative (<0)** (platykurtic), it suggests lighter tails and a flatter distribution, with fewer extreme values than a normal distribution.</li>
                    <li>If **Kurtosis is close to 0** (mesokurtic), it resembles the tailedness and peakedness of a normal distribution.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.3 Creating Graphs for Interval/Ratio Variables (Histograms & Box Plots)</h3>
        <p>Graphs provide powerful visual insights into the distribution of your data, complementing the numerical summaries. In SPSS, plots will appear in the Output Viewer window.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>For a Histogram:
                <p>Go back to <code>Analyse > Descriptive Statistics > Frequencies...</code></p>
                <p>Make sure <code>final_exam_score</code> is in the <code>Variables(s):</code> box.</p>
                <p>Click on the <code>Charts...</code> button. Select <code>Histograms</code> and optionally check <code>With normal curve</code> if you want to see if your data approximates a normal distribution.</p>
                <p>Click <code>Continue</code>, then <code>OK</code>.</p>
            </li>
            <li>For a Box Plot:
                <p>Go to <code>Graphs > Legacy Dialogs > Boxplot...</code></p>
                <p>Choose <code>Simple</code> and <code>Summaries of separate variables</code> if you just want one box plot for a single variable, then click <code>Define</code>.</p>
                <p>Move <code>final_exam_score</code> to the <code>Variable:</code> box.</p>
                <p>Click <code>OK</code>.</p>
            </li>
            <p>SPSS will generate these plots in the Output Viewer window.</p>
        </ol>

        <h3>1.4 Interpreting Graphs for Interval/Ratio Variables</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Histogram:</strong> Displays the shape of the distribution, showing where values are concentrated, identifying peaks (modes), gaps, and overall symmetry or skewness. Each bar represents a range of values (or "bin"), and its height shows the frequency of scores within that range.</li>
            <li><strong>Box Plot:</strong> Provides a clear visual representation of the "five-number summary": minimum, first quartile (Q1), median (Q2), third quartile (Q3), and maximum. It is particularly effective for identifying outliers.
                <ul>
                    <li>The box itself represents the **Interquartile Range (IQR)**, which contains the middle 50% of your data (between Q1 and Q3).</li>
                    <li>The line inside the box is the **median**.</li>
                    <li>The "whiskers" typically extend to the most extreme data points within 1.5 times the IQR from the box.</li>
                    <li>Individual points (often shown as dots or asterisks) beyond the whiskers are considered **outliers**, meaning they are unusually far from the rest of the data.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <div class="reflection-question">
            <h4>Reflection Questions & Tasks:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>For the final exam scores, compare the Mean (74.71) and Median (75.00) from your SPSS output. Based on the explanation of skewness in Section 1.2, what does the relationship between these two values suggest about the symmetry of the final exam score distribution?</li>
                <li>Consider the Skewness value (0.00) and Kurtosis value (-0.13) for the final exam scores from your SPSS output. How do these numerical values, along with the visual information from the histogram, help you describe the overall shape of this distribution? Is it symmetrical, and does it appear peaked or relatively flat compared to a typical bell curve?</li>
                <li>Examine the box plot for the final exam scores. Do you see any individual points plotted outside the main "whiskers" of the box plot? If so, what do these points represent in the context of our data?</li>
                <li><strong>Task:</strong> Now, apply the steps from Sections 1.1 to 1.4 to the variable `study_hours_per_week` in SPSS. What are its mean, median, and standard deviation? How does its distribution (shape, spread, symmetry) compare to that of the final exam scores, both numerically and visually?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-section">
            <h4>Suggested Solutions for Reflection Questions (Part 1):</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>For the final exam scores, the Mean (74.71) and Median (75.00) are very close. This indicates that the distribution of final exam scores is quite **symmetrical**, as neither the mean nor the median is significantly pulled in one direction by extreme values.</li>
                <li>The Skewness value of 0.00 suggests that the distribution of final exam scores is almost perfectly symmetrical. A Kurtosis value of -0.13, which is close to 0 but slightly negative, indicates that the distribution is slightly **platykurtic** (a bit flatter than a normal distribution), meaning it has slightly lighter tails and fewer extreme values. The histogram should visually confirm this: a roughly bell-shaped curve with no pronounced long tail on either side.</li>
                <li>For the final exam scores, the box plot **does not show any individual points** beyond the whiskers. This signifies that there are no statistical **outliers** detected in this dataset for final exam scores, based on the 1.5 IQR rule. If points were present, they would represent unusually high or low scores compared to the majority of the data.</li>
                <li><strong>Task Solution (for `study_hours_per_week`):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>N:</strong> 100</li>

                        <li><strong>Median:</strong> 18.50</li>
                        <li><strong>Mode:</strong> [16.7, 20.1] (This is bimodal, meaning these two values appear with the highest frequency. SPSS might only show one or indicate multiple.)</li>
                        <li><strong>Standard Deviation:</strong> 7.39</li>
                        <li><strong>Variance:</strong> 54.66</li>

                        <li><strong>Maximum:</strong> 40.0</li>
                        <li><strong>Skewness:</strong> 0.38 (Slightly positively skewed - the tail extends slightly to the right, meaning a few students study a lot more hours).</li>
                        <li><strong>Kurtosis:</strong> 0.07 (Very slightly leptokurtic, near normal peakedness, suggesting the tails are not excessively heavy or light).</li>
                        <li>**Comparison:** Compared to the final exam scores, the study hours per week variable has a larger standard deviation (7.39 vs. 5.76), indicating more variability in the reported study hours among students. While the final exam scores distribution is highly symmetrical, the study hours per week variable shows a slight positive skew (Mean 19.28 > Median 18.50), indicating a slight tendency for more students to study fewer hours, with a tail extending towards higher study hours.</li>

            <p>To describe the distribution of final exam scores, descriptive statistics were computed. The sample consisted of N = 100 participants. The mean final exam score was 74.71 (SD = 5.76), with scores ranging from a minimum of 60 to a maximum of 89. The median score was 75.00. The distribution of final exam scores appeared highly symmetrical with a slightly light-tailed distribution, as indicated by the skewness (0.00) and kurtosis (-0.13) values, respectively. A histogram and box plot further illustrate these characteristics, showing a unimodal distribution with no apparent outliers.</p>

        <h2>Part 2: Analysing Categorical Variables</h2>
        <p>Categorical variables represent types of data which can be divided into groups or categories. This includes nominal variables (categories without inherent order, e.g., 'preferred study method') and ordinal variables (categories with a meaningful order, e.g., satisfaction ratings like 'Low', 'Medium', 'High'). For categorical variables, we focus on frequencies and proportions rather than means and standard deviations, as these mathematical operations are not meaningful for non-numerical categories.</p>

        <h3>2.1 Obtaining Frequency Tables for Categorical Variables (e.g., preferred_study_method)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>With your <code>omni.sav</code> file open, go to the menu bar: <code>Analyse > Descriptive Statistics > Frequencies...</code></li>
            <li>Move your categorical variable (e.g., <code>preferred_study_method</code>) to the <code>Variables(s):</code> box.</li>
            <li>Ensure <code>Display frequency tables</code> is checked at the bottom-left of the dialog box.</li>
            <li>You can optionally uncheck other statistics under the <code>Statistics...</code> button if they are not relevant (e.g., mean, median, standard deviation) as they are not appropriate for nominal variables.</li>
            <li>Click <code>OK</code> in the main Frequencies dialog box.</li>
            <p>SPSS will now display the frequency table in the Output Viewer, showing counts and percentages for each category.</p>
        </ol>

        <h3>2.2 Interpreting Frequency Tables for Categorical Variables</h3>
        <p>A frequency table lists each category of your variable and shows how many times it appears in your data (Count or Frequency) and its proportion relative to the total (Percent or Percentage).</p>

            <li><strong>Cumulative Percent:</strong> The running total of percentages. This is more meaningful for ordinal variables where categories have an inherent order.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.3 Creating Graphs for Categorical Variables (Bar Charts & Pie Charts)</h3>
        <p>Bar charts and pie charts are effective ways to visually represent the distribution of categorical variables.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>For a Bar Chart or Pie Chart:
                <p>Go back to <code>Analyse > Descriptive Statistics > Frequencies...</code></p>
                <p>Make sure your categorical variable (e.g., <code>preferred_study_method</code>) is in the <code>Variables(s):</code> box.</p>
                <p>Click on the <code>Charts...</code> button. Select either <code>Bar charts</code> or <code>Pie charts</code>. You can choose to display `Frequencies` or `Percentages` for the chart values.</p>
                <p>Click <code>Continue</code>, then <code>OK</code>.</p>
            </li>
            <p>SPSS will generate these plots in the Output Viewer window.</p>
        </ol>

        <h3>2.4 Interpreting Graphs for Categorical Variables</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bar Chart:</strong> Each bar represents a distinct category, and its height (or length) corresponds to the frequency or percentage of observations in that category. Bar charts are generally preferred over pie charts for clarity and ease of comparison, especially when comparing frequencies across multiple categories or when categories have similar proportions.</li>
            <li><strong>Pie Chart:</strong> The entire circle represents 100% of the data, and each slice represents a category's proportion of the whole. While visually intuitive for showing parts of a whole, it can be challenging to accurately compare the sizes of slices when categories have similar proportions or when there are many categories.</li>
        </ul>

            <h4>Reflection Questions & Tasks:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Based on the frequency table for 'preferred study method' from your SPSS output, identify the study method that was most frequently reported. What was its exact count and percentage of the total sample?</li>
                <li>Think about the visual strengths of a bar chart versus a pie chart. If you were presenting the distribution of 'preferred study method' to an audience, which type of graph do you think would be more effective for conveying information clearly, and why?</li>
                <li>Why do we use counts and percentages (frequency tables and bar/pie charts) for a variable like 'preferred study method', but avoid calculating a "mean" or "standard deviation"? Consider the nature of this variable.</li>
                <li><strong>Task:</strong> Apply the steps from Sections 2.1 to 2.4 to the categorical variable `study_session_group`. Obtain its frequency table and plots in SPSS. How does the distribution of students across study session groups compare to the distribution of preferred study methods?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-section">
            <h4>Suggested Solutions for Reflection Questions (Part 2):</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>For 'preferred study method', "Flashcards" was the most frequently reported method, with a **Count of 36** participants, representing **36.0%** of the total sample.</li>
                <li>A **bar chart** would generally be more effective for conveying information clearly, especially for comparing the proportions of different study methods. This is because it is easier for the human eye to accurately compare the heights of bars than to compare the angles or areas of slices in a pie chart, particularly when the percentages are similar (as they are here).</li>
                <li>We avoid calculating a "mean" or "standard deviation" for 'preferred study method' because it is a **nominal categorical variable**. Its categories ("Flashcards", "Summarising", "Practice Tests") are simply labels; they do not represent quantities or have a numerical order. Therefore, performing mathematical operations like averaging these categories would be meaningless and illogical. Mean and standard deviation are statistics designed for numerical data.</li>
                <li><strong>Task Solution (for `study_session_group`):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Medium:</strong> Count = 36, Percent = 36.0%</li>
                        <li><strong>Low:</strong> Count = 33, Percent = 33.0%</li>
                        <li><strong>High:</strong> Count = 31, Percent = 31.0%</li>
                        <li><strong>Comparison:</strong> The distribution of study session groups is quite similar to preferred study methods in that all categories have a substantial proportion of participants. Both variables show a relatively even spread across their categories, though 'Medium' for study sessions is the most frequent, just as 'Flashcards' was for study methods.</li>
                    </ul>

        <h2>Part 3: Descriptive Statistics by Groups (Splitting Data by Factors)</h2>
        <p>In data analysis, it is often insightful to understand if a numerical variable's distribution differs across distinct categories of another variable. This is known as "splitting" or "grouping" your data. For example, we might want to see if the final exam scores vary between students who used study support services and those who did not.</p>

        <h3>3.1 Analysing Interval/Ratio Variable by a Categorical Factor (e.g., final exam scores by used_study_support_services)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>First, you need to tell SPSS to split the file. Go to <code>Data > Split File...</code></li>
            <li>In the Split File dialog box:
                <ul>
                    <li>Select <code>Organise output by groups</code>.</li>
                    <li>Move your grouping variable (e.g., <code>used_study_support_services</code>) to the <code>Groups Based On:</code> box.</li>
                    <li>Click <code>OK</code>.</li>
                </ul>
                <p><strong>Important:</strong> Once Split File is active, all subsequent analyses will be run separately for each group until you turn it off. Remember to turn it off after you are done with grouped analyses!</p>
            </li>
            <li>Now, perform the descriptive statistics analysis as you did in Part 1.1:
                <p>Go to <code>Analyse > Descriptive Statistics > Frequencies...</code></p>
                <p>Move <code>final_exam_score</code> to the <code>Variables(s):</code> box.</p>
                <p>Click on <code>Statistics...</code> and select <code>Mean</code>, <code>Median</code>, <code>Std. deviation</code>, <code>Minimum</code>, <code>Maximum</code>, <code>Skewness</code>, and <code>Kurtosis</code>.</p>
                <p>Click <code>Continue</code>.</p>
                <p>Click on <code>Charts...</code> and select <code>Histograms</code> and <code>Box plots</code> (though for box plots, it's often easier to do this separately for comparison, as the Frequencies dialog creates one histogram per group).</p>
                <p>Click <code>Continue</code>, then <code>OK</code>.</p>
                <p>SPSS will now generate separate output tables and histograms for students who 'Yes' used study support services and those who 'No' did not.</p>
            </li>
            <li>To create grouped Box Plots (which are excellent for visual comparison):
                <p>Go to <code>Graphs > Legacy Dialogs > Boxplot...</code></p>
                <p>Choose <code>Simple</code> and <code>Summaries for groups of cases</code>, then click <code>Define</code>.</p>
                <p>Move <code>final_exam_score</code> to the <code>Variable:</code> box.</p>
                <p>Move <code>used_study_support_services</code> to the <code>Category Axis:</code> box.</p>
                <p>Click <code>OK</code>. This will show two box plots side-by-side for easier comparison.</p>
            </li>
            <li><p><strong>Crucially, turn off Split File when you are done:</strong> Go to <code>Data > Split File...</code>, select <code>Analyse all cases, do not create groups</code>, and click <code>OK</code>. This ensures your subsequent analyses are not inadvertently split.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>3.2 Interpreting Grouped Descriptive Statistics</h3>
        <p>By comparing the statistics and plots for each group, you can identify differences in the central tendency, spread, and shape of the numerical variable's distribution across your defined categories.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comparison of Means/Medians:</strong> Observe if the average exam scores are different for students who used support services compared to those who did not.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparison of Standard Deviations:</strong> Determine if the variability (consistency) in exam scores is different between the two groups. A larger standard deviation suggests more diverse scores within that group.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparison of Skewness/Kurtosis:</strong> Analyse if the shapes of the exam score distributions differ between the 'Yes' and 'No' groups (e.g., is one group's scores more skewed or more peaked?).</li>
            <li><strong>Box Plots:</strong> Visually compare the median lines, the size of the boxes (IQR), and the presence or absence of outliers between the groups. This provides a quick visual summary of potential group differences.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="reflection-question">
            <h4>Reflection Questions & Tasks:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Based on the grouped descriptive statistics for final exam scores when split by used study support services, what is the mean final exam score for students who used support services (76.90) compared to those who did not (72.33)? What initial conclusion can you draw from this difference?</li>
                <li>Examine the standard deviations for both groups: 'Yes' (4.77) and 'No' (5.84). What does this difference imply about the consistency or variability of final exam scores within each group?</li>
                <li>Look closely at the grouped histograms or box plots. Do the distributions of final exam scores appear to have similar shapes (e.g., symmetry, spread, presence of outliers) for both groups, or are there noticeable visual differences that stand out?</li>
                <li><strong>Task:</strong> Conduct a similar analysis. Explore the numerical variable `quiz_score_post`, but this time, split it by the categorical variable `attended_peer_study_group`. Compare the descriptive statistics and plots for students who 'Yes' attended versus 'No' attended. What patterns do you observe regarding their post-quiz scores?</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-section">
            <h4>Suggested Solutions for Reflection Questions (Part 3):</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>The mean final exam score for students who used study support services is 76.90, which is higher than the mean of 72.33 for students who did not use support services. This suggests that, in this sample, students who utilised study support services tended to achieve higher final exam scores, on average.</li>
                <li>The standard deviation for the 'Yes' group (4.77) is smaller than for the 'No' group (5.84). This implies that final exam scores among students who used study support services were generally **more consistent** (less spread out) compared to those who did not use study support services. The scores in the 'Yes' group were more clustered around their mean.</li>
                <li>For final exam scores split by used study support services:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>'No' Group:</strong> N=48, Mean=72.33, Median=72.00, StdDev=5.84, Min=60, Max=89, Skewness=0.31, Kurtosis=0.31. Mode: [68, 69, 71, 78] (multimodal).</li>
                        <li><strong>'Yes' Group:</strong> N=52, Mean=76.90, Median=76.00, StdDev=4.77, Min=68, Max=87, Skewness=0.20, Kurtosis=-0.56. Mode: [76].</li>
                    </ul>
                    Visually, the box plots will show that the 'Yes' group's distribution is centred at a higher score and its box (IQR) is narrower, indicating less variability. Both distributions appear relatively symmetrical, but the 'Yes' group might appear slightly flatter (more platykurtic) in its histogram, while the 'No' group is slightly more peaked.</li>
                <li><strong>Task Solution (for `quiz_score_post` split by `attended_peer_study_group`):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Students who DID NOT attend peer study group ('No' group):</strong> You might find a Mean of post-quiz scores of approximately 68.5 (SD ~7.2).</li>
                        <li><strong>Students who DID attend peer study group ('Yes' group):</strong> You might find a Mean of post-quiz scores of approximately 74.1 (SD ~6.5).</li>
                    </ul>
                    Based on these example numbers, students who attended peer study groups would tend to have a higher average post-quiz score and potentially slightly less variability in their scores compared to those who did not attend. This indicates a positive association between attending peer study groups and post-quiz performance in this sample.
                </li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="write-up-template">
            <h4>Write-Up Template for Grouped Interval/Ratio Variable (Example)</h4>
            <p>To compare final exam performance based on study support service usage, descriptive statistics for final exam scores were computed, split by study support service usage. Students who reported using study support services (N = 52) had a mean final exam score of 76.90 (SD = 4.77), a median of 76.00, and scores ranging from 68 to 87. In contrast, students who did not use study support services (N = 48) had a mean final exam score of 72.33 (SD = 5.84), a median of 72.00, and scores ranging from 60 to 89. This suggests that students utilising support services achieved, on average, higher and more consistent final exam scores. Further visual inspection of the grouped histograms and box plots provides additional insights into the distributions of scores for both groups. For instance, the 'Yes' group's distribution appears slightly narrower and centred at a higher score, with less variability than the 'No' group. Both distributions were relatively symmetrical, with the 'No' group having a skewness of 0.31 and kurtosis of 0.31, while the 'Yes' group had a skewness of 0.20 and kurtosis of -0.56.</p>
