        <h1>Descriptive Statistics in Stata</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">A Guide to Understanding and Summarizing Data</p>

        <p>This guide will walk you through the process of obtaining summary statistics and creating relevant graphs for different types of variables using Stata. Understanding descriptive statistics is a foundational skill in data analysis, providing essential insights into the characteristics of your dataset.</p>

        <p>Descriptive statistics help us understand the basic features of the data in a study. They provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures, forming the basis of virtually every quantitative analysis.</p>

        <p>Before you begin, ensure you have your <code>omni.dta</code> file available. You can enter commands directly into the Stata Command window (the bottom-right pane in Stata by default) or by creating a Do-file (<code>File > New > Do-file Editor</code>). Using a Do-file is highly recommended for saving your commands and making your work reproducible.</p>

        <p>In the code examples below, lines starting with `*` are comments. These are notes within the code that explain what the commands are doing. They are very useful for keeping track of your analysis steps in a Do-file. If you are entering commands directly into the Stata Command window, you do not need to copy the * or the comments after it.</p>

        <p>First, we need to load the data. We will use the `use` command for this. Before loading your data, ensure your `omni.dta` file is in your Stata working directory. You can set your working directory using the Stata menu: <code>File > Change Working Directory...</code></p>

        <pre><code>use "omni.dta", clear
* This command loads the Stata data file named "omni.dta" into Stata's memory.
* The `clear` option clears any data currently in memory before loading.</code></pre>
        <p>Your data is now loaded into Stata. You can refer to variables by their names as they appear in the Data Editor or Variables window.</p>
        <p>For more detailed instructions on loading data into Stata, please refer to the <a href="../loading_the_data/guide_st.html">Loading Data into Stata Guide</a>.</p>

        <p>Throughout this guide, we will use specific variables from your dataset to illustrate the concepts. You will also be prompted to apply the steps to other relevant variables:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>final_exam_score</code>: Represents the numerical score achieved by students on a final exam.</li>
            <li><code>study_hours_per_week</code>: Indicates the number of hours a student reported studying each week.</li>
            <li><code>preferred_study_method</code>: Describes a student's chosen study strategy (e.g., 'Summarizing', 'Practice Tests', 'Flashcards').</li>
            <li><code>study_session_group</code>: A categorical variable indicating the type of study session group a student was assigned to (e.g., 'High', 'Medium', 'Low').</li>
            <li><code>used_study_support_services</code>: A categorical variable indicating whether a student utilized study support services (Yes/No). This variable will be used to demonstrate splitting analyses by groups.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>Part 1: Analyzing Interval/Ratio Variables</h2>
        <p>Interval/ratio variables are numerical variables where the differences between values are meaningful. For example, a 10-point difference in exam scores means the same regardless of the score range. Ratio variables also have a true zero point (e.g., age, income, test scores, study hours), where zero indicates an absence of the quantity. For these types of variables, we typically examine measures of central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (standard deviation, variance, range).</p>

        <h3>1.1 Obtaining Summary Statistics for Interval/Ratio Variables (e.g., final_exam_score)</h3>
        <p>You can obtain descriptive statistics using the <code>summarize</code> command for basic statistics or the <code>summarize, detail</code> command for a more comprehensive summary.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Using `summarize` (Basic Statistics):</strong>
                <p>To get basic statistics like count, mean, standard deviation, minimum, and maximum for a variable like <code>final_exam_score</code>, use the <code>summarize</code> command.</p>
                <pre><code>summarize final_exam_score</code></pre>
                <p>This command will output a table with the number of observations (Obs), Mean, Standard Deviation (Std. Dev.), Minimum (Min), and Maximum (Max) for the specified variable.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Using `summarize, detail` (Comprehensive Summary):</strong>
                <p>For a more comprehensive set of descriptive statistics, including N, mean, standard deviation, variance, skewness, kurtosis, and various percentiles (including the median), use the <code>summarize</code> command with the <code>detail</code> option.</p>
                <pre><code>summarize final_exam_score, detail</code></pre>
                <p>This command provides a much richer output, including the mean, standard deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis. It also lists the smallest and largest values, along with various percentiles, giving you a detailed picture of the variable's distribution.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>1.2 Interpreting Summary Statistics for Interval/Ratio Variables</h3>
        <p>Here's what each statistic (as provided by <code>summarize, detail</code>) tells us:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Percentiles:</strong> Values below which a certain percentage of observations fall (e.g., 50th percentile is the median).</li>
            <li><strong>Smallest/Largest:</strong> The minimum and maximum values in your dataset.</li>
            <li><strong>Obs:</strong> The total number of valid observations (N).</li>
            <li><strong>Mean:</strong> The arithmetic average of all values. It is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of observations. It is sensitive to extreme values (outliers).</li>
            <li><strong>Std. Dev.:</strong> Standard Deviation. A measure of the typical distance data points are from the mean. A smaller standard deviation indicates data points are clustered closely around the mean, while a larger one indicates more spread or variability in the data.</li>
            <li><strong>Variance:</strong> The average of the squared differences from the mean. It's the square of the standard deviation.</li>
            <li><strong>Skewness:</strong> Indicates the symmetry of the distribution.
                <ul>
                    <li>If Skewness is close to 0, the distribution is relatively symmetrical.</li>
                    <li>If Skewness is positive (>0), the tail of the distribution extends to the right (positive direction). The Mean > Median.</li>
                    <li>If Skewness is negative (<0), the tail extends to the left (negative direction). The Mean < Median.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li>Kurtosis: Indicates the "tailedness" or peakedness of the distribution compared to a normal distribution. Stata's <code>summarize, detail</code> reports raw kurtosis.
                <ul>
                    <li>If Kurtosis is close to 3, it resembles the tailedness and peakedness of a normal distribution (mesokurtic).</li>
                    <li>If Kurtosis is greater than 3 (leptokurtic), it suggests heavier tails and a more peaked distribution, potentially indicating more outliers.</li>
                    <li>If Kurtosis is less than 3 (platykurtic), it suggests lighter tails and a flatter distribution, with fewer extreme values than a normal distribution.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note: Different statistical software or packages may use slightly different computational algorithms or default settings for calculating skewness and kurtosis. This can lead to minor variations in the reported numerical values, but the general interpretation of the shape (e.g., positive skew, platykurtic) remains consistent.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.3 Creating Graphs for Interval/Ratio Variables (Histograms & Box Plots)</h3>
        <p>Graphs provide powerful visual insights into the distribution of your data, complementing the numerical summaries.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>For Histograms:</strong>
                <p>Use the <code>histogram</code> command. This command creates a histogram of the specified numerical variable.
                <ul>
                    <li><code>histogram final_exam_score</code>: This is the basic command to generate a histogram for <code>final_exam_score</code>.</li>
                    <li><code>normal</code>: (Optional) Adds a normal density curve to the histogram, useful for visual comparison.</li>
                    <li><code>title("Final Exam Scores")</code>: Sets the main title of the plot.</li>
                    <li><code>xtitle("Final Exam Score")</code>: Sets the label for the x-axis.</li>
                    <li><code>ytitle("Density")</code>: Sets the label for the y-axis (Stata's default for histograms is density).</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <pre><code>histogram final_exam_score, normal title("Final Exam Scores") xtitle("Final Exam Score") ytitle("Density")</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li><strong>For Box Plots:</strong>
                <p>Use the <code>graph box</code> command. This command creates a box and whisker plot for the specified numerical variable.
                <ul>
                    <li><code>graph box final_exam_score</code>: This is the basic command to generate a box plot for <code>final_exam_score</code>.</li>
                    <li><code>title("Final Exam Scores")</code>: Sets the main title of the plot.</li>
                    <li><code>ytitle("Final Exam Score")</code>: Sets the label for the y-axis.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <pre><code>graph box final_exam_score, title("Final Exam Scores") ytitle("Final Exam Score")</code></pre>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>1.4 Interpreting Graphs for Interval/Ratio Variables</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Histogram:</strong> Displays the shape of the distribution, showing where values are concentrated, identifying peaks (modes), gaps, and overall symmetry or skewness.

            <h4>Reflection Questions & Tasks:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>For the final exam scores, compare the Mean (74.71) and Median (75.00). Based on the explanation of skewness in Section 1.2, what does the relationship between these two values suggest about the symmetry of the final exam score distribution?</li>
                <li>Consider the Skewness value (0.00) and Kurtosis value (2.82) for the final exam scores. How do these numerical values, along with the visual information from the histogram, help you describe the overall shape of this distribution? Is it symmetrical, and does it appear peaked or relatively flat compared to a typical bell curve?</li>
                <li>Examine the box plot for the final exam scores. Do you see any individual points plotted outside the main "whiskers" of the box plot? If so, what do these points represent in the context of our data?</li>
                <li><strong>Task:</strong> Now, apply the steps from Sections 1.1 to 1.4 to the variable <code>study_hours_per_week</code> in your Stata environment. What are its mean, median, and standard deviation?</li>

            <ol>
                <li>For the final exam scores, the Mean (74.71) and Median (75.00) are very close. This indicates that the distribution of final exam scores is quite <strong>symmetrical</strong>, as neither the mean nor the median is significantly pulled in one direction by extreme values.</li>
                <li>The Skewness value of 0.00 suggests that the distribution of final exam scores is almost perfectly symmetrical. A Kurtosis value of 2.82, which is less than 3, indicates that the distribution is slightly <strong>platykurtic</strong> (a bit flatter than a normal distribution), meaning it has slightly lighter tails and fewer extreme values. The histogram should visually confirm this: a roughly bell-shaped curve with no pronounced long tail on either side.</li>
                <li>For the final exam scores, the box plot <strong>does not show any individual points</strong> beyond the whiskers. This signifies that there are no statistical <strong>outliers</strong> detected in this dataset for final exam scores, based on the 1.5 IQR rule. If points were present, they would represent unusually high or low scores compared to the majority of the data.</li>

        <h2>Part 2: Analyzing Categorical Variables</h2>
        <p>Categorical variables represent types of data which can be divided into groups or categories. This includes nominal variables (categories without inherent order, e.g., 'preferred study method', where 'Flashcards' is not "better" or "more" than 'Summarizing') and ordinal variables (categories with a meaningful order, e.g., satisfaction ratings like 'Low', 'Medium', 'High'). For categorical variables, we focus on frequencies and proportions rather than means and standard deviations, as these mathematical operations are not meaningful for non-numerical categories.</p>

        <h3>2.1 Obtaining Frequency Tables for Categorical Variables (e.g., preferred_study_method)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To get a frequency table for a categorical variable like <code>preferred_study_method</code>, use the <code>tabulate</code> command. This will give you the counts and percentages for each category.</li>
            <pre><code>tabulate preferred_study_method</code></pre>
            <p>This command will output a table showing the frequency (count), percentage, and cumulative percentage for each category of the <code>preferred_study_method</code> variable.</p>
        </ol>

        <h3>2.2 Interpreting Frequency Tables for Categorical Variables</h3>
        <p>A frequency table lists each category of your variable and shows how many times it appears in your data (Frequency) and its proportion relative to the total (Percent).</p>

        <h3>2.3 Creating Graphs for Categorical Variables (Bar Charts)</h3>
        <p>Graphs provide powerful visual insights into the distribution of your data, complementing the numerical summaries.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To create a bar chart for a categorical variable like <code>preferred_study_method</code>, use the <code>graph bar</code> command. You can choose to display counts or percentages.
                <p>Use the <code>graph bar</code> command. This command creates a bar chart.
                <ul>
                    <li><code>(count)</code>: Specifies that the height of the bars should represent the frequency (count) of observations in each category. You could also use <code>(percent)</code> for percentages.</li>
                    <li><code>over(preferred_study_method)</code>: This option tells Stata to create separate bars for each category of the <code>preferred_study_method</code> variable.</li>
                    <li><code>title("Preferred Study Methods")</code>: Sets the main title of the plot.</li>
                    <li><code>ytitle("Frequency")</code>: Sets the label for the y-axis.</li>
                    <li><code>ylabel(, labsize(small))</code>: Adjusts the size of the y-axis labels.</li>

        <h3>2.4 Interpreting Graphs for Categorical Variables</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bar Chart:</strong> Each bar represents a distinct category, and its height (or length) corresponds to the frequency or percentage of observations in that category. Bar charts are generally preferred over pie charts for clarity and ease of comparison, especially when comparing frequencies across multiple categories or when categories have similar proportions.</li>

        <h2>Part 3: Descriptive Statistics by Groups (Splitting Data by Factors)</h2>
        <p>In data analysis, it is often insightful to understand if a numerical variable's distribution differs across distinct categories of another variable. This is known as "splitting" or "grouping" your data. For example, we might want to see if the final exam scores vary between students who used study support services and those who did not.</p>

        <h3>3.1 Analyzing Interval/Ratio Variable by a Categorical Factor (e.g., final exam scores by used_study_support_services)</h3>
        <p>To obtain descriptive statistics for a numerical variable, grouped by a categorical variable, you have two main approaches: using the <code>bysort</code> prefix with <code>summarize, detail</code> for a comprehensive output, or using the <code>tabstat</code> command with its <code>by()</code> option for more selective statistics.</p>

        <h4>Method 1: Using `bysort` with `summarize, detail`</h4>
        <p>The <code>bysort</code> prefix in Stata allows you to repeat a command for each unique group within a specified variable. When combined with <code>summarize, detail</code>, it provides a full set of descriptive statistics for your numerical variable, broken down by the categories of your grouping variable.</p>
        <p>The general syntax is <code>bysort group_variable: command</code>.</p>
        <pre><code>bysort used_study_support_services: summarize final_exam_score, detail</code></pre>
        <p>Let's break down what each part of this command does:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>bysort used_study_support_services:</code>: This prefix tells Stata to sort the data by the <code>used_study_support_services</code> variable first, and then to run the subsequent command (<code>summarize final_exam_score, detail</code>) separately for each unique value (group) of <code>used_study_support_services</code>.</li>
            <li><code>summarize final_exam_score, detail</code>: This is the command that is executed for each group. As explained in Part 1.1, the <code>detail</code> option provides a comprehensive summary including mean, standard deviation, skewness, and kurtosis.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>This command will produce separate detailed summary tables for <code>final_exam_score</code> for students who 'No' used study support services and those who 'Yes' used study support services.</p>

        <h4>Method 2: Using `tabstat` with `by()`</h4>
        <p>The <code>tabstat</code> command is highly flexible and allows you to specify exactly which statistics you want to display for one or more variables, and it can easily group these statistics by a categorical variable using the <code>by()</code> option.</p>
        <pre><code>tabstat final_exam_score, by(used_study_support_services) stats(N mean sd median min max skewness kurtosis)</code></pre>
        <p>Let's break down what each part of this command does:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>tabstat final_exam_score</code>: This specifies that you want to calculate statistics for the <code>final_exam_score</code> variable.</li>
            <li><code>by(used_study_support_services)</code>: This option tells Stata to calculate the statistics separately for each category within the <code>used_study_support_services</code> variable.</li>
            <li><code>stats(N mean sd median min max skewness kurtosis)</code>: This option specifies exactly which statistics you want to see in the output.
                <ul>
                    <li><code>N</code>: Number of observations.</li>
                    <li><code>mean</code>: Mean.</li>
                    <li><code>sd</code>: Standard deviation.</li>
                    <li><code>median</code>: Median (50th percentile).</li>
                    <li><code>min</code>: Minimum value.</li>
                    <li><code>max</code>: Maximum value.</li>
                    <li><code>skewness</code>: Skewness.</li>
                    <li><code>kurtosis</code>: Kurtosis.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>This command will produce a single table showing the specified summary statistics for <code>final_exam_score</code>, broken down by <code>used_study_support_services</code>.</p>

        <h4>Creating Grouped Graphs</h4>
        <p>Stata also allows you to easily create grouped histograms and box plots using the <code>by()</code> option with the respective graphing commands.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>For Grouped Histograms:</strong>
                <p>Use the <code>histogram</code> command with the <code>by()</code> option to create separate histograms for each group.
                <ul>
                    <li><code>histogram final_exam_score, by(used_study_support_services)</code>: This creates separate histograms for <code>final_exam_score</code>, one for each category of <code>used_study_support_services</code>.</li>
                    <li><code>xtitle("Final Exam Score")</code>: Sets the label for the x-axis within each histogram.</li>
                    <li><code>ytitle("Density")</code>: Sets the label for the y-axis within each histogram.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <pre><code>histogram final_exam_score, by(used_study_support_services) xtitle("Final Exam Score") ytitle("Density")</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li><strong>For Grouped Box Plots:</strong>
                <p>Use the <code>graph box</code> command with the <code>by()</code> option to create separate box plots for each group.
                <ul>
                    <li><code>graph box final_exam_score, by(used_study_support_services)</code>: This creates separate box plots for <code>final_exam_score</code> for each category of <code>used_study_support_services</code>.</li>
                    <li><code>ytitle("Final Exam Score")</code>: Sets the label for the y-axis.</li>
                </ul>
                </p>
                <pre><code>graph box final_exam_score, by(used_study_support_services) ytitle("Final Exam Score")</code></pre>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>3.2 Interpreting Grouped Descriptive Statistics</h3>
        <p>By comparing the statistics and plots for each group, you can identify differences in the central tendency, spread, and shape of the numerical variable's distribution across your defined categories.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comparison of Means/Medians:</strong> Observe if the average exam scores are different for students who used support services compared to those who did not.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparison of Standard Deviations:</strong> Determine if the variability (consistency) in exam scores is different between the two groups. A larger standard deviation suggests more diverse scores within that group.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparison of Skewness/Kurtosis:</strong> Analyze if the shapes of the exam score distributions differ between the 'Yes' and 'No' groups (e.g., is one group's scores more skewed or more peaked?).</li>
            <li><strong>Box Plots:</strong> Visually compare the median lines, the size of the boxes (IQR), and the presence or absence of outliers between the groups. This provides a quick visual summary of potential group differences.</li>
        </ul>

                <li>Based on the grouped descriptive statistics for final exam scores when split by <code>used_study_support_services</code>, what is the mean final exam score for students who used support services compared to those who did not? What initial conclusion can you draw from this difference?</li>
                <li>Examine the standard deviations for both groups: 'Yes' (4.77) and 'No' (5.84). What does this difference imply about the consistency or variability of final exam scores within each group?</li>

                <li>Examine the standard deviations for both groups: 'Yes' (4.77) and 'No' (5.84).

                    <ul>
                        <li>'No' Group: N=48, Mean=72.33, Median=72.00, StdDev=5.84, Min=60, Max=89, Skewness=0.30, Kurtosis=3.16.</li>
                        <li>'Yes' Group: N=52, Mean=76.90, Median=76.00, StdDev=4.77, Min=68, Max=87, Skewness=0.20, Kurtosis=2.38.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Visually, the box plots will show that the 'Yes' group's distribution is centered at a higher score and its box (IQR) is narrower, indicating less variability. Both distributions appear relatively symmetrical, but the 'Yes' group shows a more pronounced platykurtic (flatter) shape with a kurtosis of 2.38 (less than 3), while the 'No' group's kurtosis of 3.16 is slightly leptokurtic (greater than 3).</li>
                <li><strong>Task Solution (for <code>quiz_score_post</code> split by <code>attended_peer_study_group</code>):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Students who DID NOT attend peer study group ('No' group): N=47, Mean=71.32, Median=71, SD=8.63, Minimum=50, Maximum=88, Skewness=-0.30, Kurtosis=2.85.</li>
                        <li>Students who DID attend peer study group ('Yes' group): N=53, Mean=70.75, Median=71, SD=10.62, Minimum=49, Maximum=95, Skewness=-0.14, Kurtosis=2.56.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Based on these numbers, students who attended peer study groups ('Yes' group) had a slightly lower mean post-quiz score (70.75) compared to those who did not attend ('No' group, 71.32). The 'Yes' group also shows a larger standard deviation (10.62 vs 8.63), indicating more variability in their post-quiz scores. Both distributions appear slightly negatively skewed and platykurtic (kurtosis less than 3), with the 'Yes' group showing a slightly more platykurtic shape. This suggests that in this sample, attending peer study groups did not lead to higher average post-quiz scores and was associated with more varied performance.

            <h4>Write-Up Template for Grouped Interval/Ratio Variable (Example)</h4>
            <p>To compare final exam performance based on study support service usage, descriptive statistics for final exam scores were computed, split by study support service usage. Students who reported using study support services (N = 52) had a mean final exam score of 76.90 (SD = 4.77), a median of 76.00, and scores ranging from 68 to 87. In contrast, students who did not use study support services (N = 48) had a mean final exam score of 72.33 (SD = 5.84), a median of 72.00, and scores ranging from 60 to 89. This suggests that students utilizing support services achieved, on average, higher and more consistent final exam scores. Further visual inspection of the grouped histograms and box plots provides additional insights into the distributions of scores for both groups. For instance, the 'Yes' group's distribution appears slightly narrower and centered at a higher score, with less variability than the 'No' group. Both distributions were relatively symmetrical, with the 'No' group having a skewness of 0.30 and kurtosis of 3.16, while the 'Yes' group had a skewness of 0.20 and kurtosis = 2.38.</p>
