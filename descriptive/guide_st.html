        <h1>Descriptive Statistics in Stata</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">A Guide to Understanding and Summarising Data using Stata</p>

        <p>This guide will walk you through the process of obtaining summary statistics and creating relevant graphs for different types of variables using Stata. Understanding descriptive statistics is a foundational skill in data analysis, providing essential insights into the characteristics of your dataset.</p>

        <p>Descriptive statistics help us understand the basic features of the data in a study. They provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures, forming the basis of virtually every quantitative analysis.</p>

        <p>Before you begin, ensure you have your <code>omni.dta</code> file available. Throughout this guide, we will use specific variables from your dataset to illustrate the concepts. You will also be prompted to apply the steps to other relevant variables:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>final_exam_score</code>: Represents the numerical score achieved by students on a final exam.</li>
            <li><code>study_hours_per_week</code>: Indicates the number of hours a student reported studying each week.</li>
            <li><code>preferred_study_method</code>: Describes a student's chosen study strategy (e.g., 'Flashcards', 'Summarising', 'Practice Tests'). This variable will have already been converted to a numerical nominal format with value labels attached.</li>
            <li><code>study_session_group</code>: A categorical variable indicating the type of study session group a student was assigned to (e.g., 'High', 'Medium', 'Low'). This variable will also have already been converted to a numerical nominal format with value labels attached.</li>
            <li><code>used_study_support_services</code>: A categorical variable indicating whether a student utilised study support services (Yes/No). This variable will be used to demonstrate splitting analyses by groups, and will also have been converted to a numerical nominal format.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To open your data in Stata:</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Launch Stata.</li>
            <li>**Menu Driven:** Go to <code>File > Open...</code>, navigate to your <code>omni.dta</code> file, select it, and click <code>Open</code>.</li>
            <li>**Command:** In the Command window, type:
                <pre><code>
use "omni.dta", clear
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                    The `use` command loads a Stata dataset (`.dta` file) into memory. `"omni.dta"` is the name of your data file. The `clear` option tells Stata to clear any data currently in memory before loading the new dataset. This is useful to prevent errors if you have another dataset open.
                </p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <hr>

        <h2>Part 1: Analysing Interval/Ratio Variables</h2>
        <p>Interval/ratio variables are numerical variables where the differences between values are meaningful. For example, a 10-point difference in exam scores means the same regardless of the score range. Ratio variables also have a true zero point (e.g., age, income, test scores, study hours), where zero indicates an absence of the quantity. For these types of variables, we typically examine measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (standard deviation, variance, range).</p>

        <h3>1.1 Obtaining Summary Statistics for Interval/Ratio Variables (e.g., final_exam_score)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>With your <code>omni.dta</code> file open in Stata.</li>
            <li>To get a quick summary of a numerical variable, including N, Mean, Standard Deviation, Min, and Max:</li>
            <li>**Menu Driven:** Go to <code>Statistics > Summaries, tables, and tests > Summary and descriptive statistics > Summary statistics</code>. In the dialog box, move <code>final_exam_score</code> to the <code>Variables:</code> box and click <code>OK</code>.</li>
            <li>**Command:** In the Command window, type:
                <pre><code>
summarize final_exam_score
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                    The `summarize` command provides basic descriptive statistics for numerical variables. `final_exam_score` is the variable you want to summarise.
                </p>
            </li>
            <li>For more detailed statistics, including Median, Skewness, and Kurtosis:</li>
            <li>**Menu Driven:** Go to <code>Statistics > Summaries, tables, and tests > Summary and descriptive statistics > Summary statistics</code>. In the dialog box, move <code>final_exam_score</code> to the <code>Variables:</code> box. Click on the <code>Details</code> tab, then check <code>Display additional statistics (includes skewness and kurtosis)</code>. Click <code>OK</code>.</li>
            <li>**Command:** In the Command window, type:
                <pre><code>
summarize final_exam_score, detail
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                    Adding the `, detail` option to the `summarize` command provides a more extensive table of descriptive statistics, including percentiles (which includes the median), variance, skewness, and kurtosis.
                </p>
            </li>
            <p>Example Output (for `summarize final_exam_score, detail` - your exact values might vary slightly):</p>
            <pre><code>

        <h3>1.2 Interpreting Summary Statistics for Interval/Ratio Variables</h3>
        <p>Here's what each statistic tells us:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Obs (Observations):</strong> The total number of valid observations for the variable. Stata automatically handles missing values for these calculations.</li>
            <li><strong>Mean:</strong> The arithmetic average of all values. It is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of observations. The mean is sensitive to extreme values (outliers), meaning it can be pulled towards very high or very low scores.</li>
            <li><strong>Median (50th Percentile):</strong> The middle value when data is ordered from smallest to largest. It's the value at which 50% of the data falls below it and 50% above it. The median is less affected by outliers than the mean, making it a good measure of typical value in skewed distributions.</li>
            <li><strong>Mode:</strong> The value that appears most frequently in the dataset. Stata's `summarize, detail` does not directly report the mode, but you can find it using other commands or by inspecting frequency tables for discrete data. For continuous data, it's often more about identifying peaks in a histogram.</li>
            <li><strong>Std. Dev. (Standard Deviation):</strong> A measure of the typical distance data points are from the mean. A smaller standard deviation indicates data points are clustered closely around the mean, while a larger one indicates more spread or variability in the data.</li>
            <li><strong>Variance:</strong> The average of the squared differences from the Mean. It is the square of the standard deviation. It gives a numerical value describing the spread of data points.</li>
            <li><strong>Smallest & Largest (Min & Max):</strong> The smallest and largest values observed in your dataset for that variable. This gives you the range of your data.</li>
            <li><strong>Skewness:</strong> Indicates the symmetry of the distribution.
                <ul>
                    <li>If **Skewness is close to 0**, the distribution is relatively symmetrical (e.g., a bell curve). In symmetrical distributions, the mean, median, and mode are often very close to each other.</li>
                    <li>If **Skewness is positive (>0)**, the tail of the distribution extends to the right (positive direction). This typically means there are more lower values, with a few higher, extreme values pulling the mean to the right of the median. In this case, the Mean > Median.</li>
                    <li>If **Skewness is negative (<0)**, the tail extends to the left (negative direction). This typically means there are more higher values, with a few lower, extreme values pulling the mean to the left of the median. In this case, the Mean < Median.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Kurtosis:</strong> Indicates the "tailedness" or peakedness of the distribution compared to a normal distribution.
                <ul>
                    <li>If **Kurtosis is positive (>0)** (leptokurtic), it suggests heavier tails and a more peaked distribution, potentially indicating more outliers (extreme values).</li>
                    <li>If **Kurtosis is negative (<0)** (platykurtic), it suggests lighter tails and a flatter distribution, with fewer extreme values than a normal distribution.</li>
                    <li>If **Kurtosis is close to 0** (mesokurtic), it resembles the tailedness and peakedness of a normal distribution.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.3 Creating Graphs for Interval/Ratio Variables (Histograms & Box Plots)</h3>
        <p>Graphs provide powerful visual insights into the distribution of your data, complementing the numerical summaries. In Stata, plots will appear in a separate Graph window.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>For a Histogram:
                <li>**Menu Driven:** Go to <code>Graphics > Histogram</code>. In the dialog box, move <code>final_exam_score</code> to the <code>Variable:</code> box. You can also select the `Normal density plot` checkbox to overlay a normal curve. Click <code>OK</code>.</li>
                <li>**Command:** In the Command window, type:
                    <pre><code>
histogram final_exam_score, normal
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        The `histogram` command creates a histogram. `final_exam_score` is the variable. The `, normal` option overlays a normal density curve on the histogram, which helps visually assess normality.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </li>
            <li>For a Box Plot:
                <li>**Menu Driven:** Go to <code>Graphics > Box plot</code>. In the dialog box, move <code>final_exam_score</code> to the <code>Variable for y axis:</code> box. Click <code>OK</code>.</li>
                <li>**Command:** In the Command window, type:
                    <pre><code>
graph box final_exam_score
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        The `graph box` command creates a box plot. `final_exam_score` is the numerical variable for which to create the plot.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </li>
            <p>Stata will generate these plots in separate Graph windows.</p>
        </ol>

        <h3>1.4 Interpreting Graphs for Interval/Ratio Variables</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Histogram:</strong> Displays the shape of the distribution, showing where values are concentrated, identifying peaks (modes), gaps, and overall symmetry or skewness. Each bar represents a range of values (or "bin"), and its height shows the frequency of scores within that range.</li>

            <h4>Reflection Questions & Tasks:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>For the final exam scores, compare the Mean (74.71) and Median (75.00) from your Stata output. Based on the explanation of skewness in Section 1.2, what does the relationship between these two values suggest about the symmetry of the final exam score distribution?</li>
                <li>Consider the Skewness value (0.00) and Kurtosis value (-0.13) for the final exam scores from your Stata output. How do these numerical values, along with the visual information from the histogram, help you describe the overall shape of this distribution? Is it symmetrical, and does it appear peaked or relatively flat compared to a typical bell curve?</li>
                <li>Examine the box plot for the final exam scores. Do you see any individual points plotted outside the main "whiskers" of the box plot? If so, what do these points represent in the context of our data?</li>
                <li><strong>Task:</strong> Now, apply the steps from Sections 1.1 to 1.4 to the variable `study_hours_per_week` in Stata. What are its mean, median, and standard deviation? How does its distribution (shape, spread, symmetry) compare to that of the final exam scores, both numerically and visually?</li>

        <div class="solution-section">
            <h4>Suggested Solutions for Reflection Questions (Part 1):</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>For the final exam scores, the Mean (74.71) and Median (75.00) are very close. This indicates that the distribution of final exam scores is quite **symmetrical**, as neither the mean nor the median is significantly pulled in one direction by extreme values.</li>
                <li>The Skewness value of 0.00 suggests that the distribution of final exam scores is almost perfectly symmetrical. A Kurtosis value of -0.13, which is close to 0 but slightly negative, indicates that the distribution is slightly **platykurtic** (a bit flatter than a normal distribution), meaning it has slightly lighter tails and fewer extreme values. The histogram should visually confirm this: a roughly bell-shaped curve with no pronounced long tail on either side.</li>
                <li>For the final exam scores, the box plot **does not show any individual points** beyond the whiskers. This signifies that there are no statistical **outliers** detected in this dataset for final exam scores, based on the 1.5 IQR rule. If points were present, they would represent unusually high or low scores compared to the majority of the data.</li>
                <li><strong>Task Solution (for `study_hours_per_week`):</strong>

                        <li><strong>Mode:</strong> [16.7, 20.1] (This is bimodal, meaning these two values appear with the highest frequency. Stata might only show one or indicate multiple.)</li>
                        <li><strong>Standard Deviation:</strong> 7.39</li>
                        <li><strong>Variance:</strong> 54.66</li>

                        <li><strong>Skewness:</strong> 0.38 (Slightly positively skewed - the tail extends slightly to the right, meaning a few students study a lot more hours).</li>
                        <li><strong>Kurtosis:</strong> 0.07 (Very slightly leptokurtic, near normal peakedness, suggesting the tails are not excessively heavy or light).</li>
                        <li>**Comparison:** Compared to the final exam scores, the study hours per week variable has a larger standard deviation (7.39 vs. 5.76), indicating more variability in the reported study hours among students. While the final exam scores distribution is highly symmetrical, the study hours per week variable shows a slight positive skew (Mean 19.28 > Median 18.50), indicating a slight tendency for more students to study fewer hours, with a tail extending towards higher study hours.</li>

        <h2>Part 2: Analysing Categorical Variables</h2>
        <p>Categorical variables represent types of data which can be divided into groups or categories. This includes nominal variables (categories without inherent order, e.g., 'preferred study method') and ordinal variables (categories with a meaningful order, e.g., satisfaction ratings like 'Low', 'Medium', 'High'). For categorical variables, we focus on frequencies and proportions rather than means and standard deviations, as these mathematical operations are not meaningful for non-numerical categories.</p>

        <h3>2.1 Obtaining Frequency Tables for Categorical Variables (e.g., preferred_study_method)</h3>

                <p>
                    The `tabulate` command (or `tab` for short) creates one-way frequency tables for categorical variables. It shows the frequency, percentage, and cumulative percentage for each category.
                </p>

        <h3>2.3 Creating Graphs for Categorical Variables (Bar Charts & Pie Charts)</h3>
        <p>Bar charts and pie charts are effective ways to visually represent the distribution of categorical variables.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>For a Bar Chart:
                <li>**Menu Driven:** Go to <code>Graphics > Bar chart</code>. Select <code>Simple</code> and then <code>Bars represent: Counts of observations</code>. In the <code>Categories (x axis):</code> tab, move <code>preferred_study_method</code> to the <code>Category variable:</code> box. Click <code>OK</code>.</li>
                <li>**Command:** In the Command window, type:
                    <pre><code>
graph bar (count), over(preferred_study_method)
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        The `graph bar` command creates a bar chart. `(count)` tells Stata to plot the count of observations for each category. `over(preferred_study_method)` specifies that the bars should be created for each category of `preferred_study_method`.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </li>
            <li>For a Pie Chart:
                <li>**Menu Driven:** Go to <code>Graphics > Pie chart</code>. Select <code>Pie chart for counts of unique values</code>. In the dialog box, move <code>preferred_study_method</code> to the <code>Category variable:</code> box. Click <code>OK</code>.</li>

graph pie, over(preferred_study_method)
                    </code></pre>
                    <p>
                        The `graph pie` command creates a pie chart. `over(preferred_study_method)` tells Stata to create slices based on the categories of `preferred_study_method`.
                    </p>
                </li>
            </li>

        <h3>2.4 Interpreting Graphs for Categorical Variables</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bar Chart:</strong> Each bar represents a distinct category, and its height (or length) corresponds to the frequency or percentage of observations in that category. Bar charts are generally preferred over pie charts for clarity and ease of comparison, especially when comparing frequencies across multiple categories or when categories have similar proportions.</li>
            <li><strong>Pie Chart:</strong> The entire circle represents 100% of the data, and each slice represents a category's proportion of the whole. While visually intuitive for showing parts of a whole, it can be challenging to accurately compare the sizes of slices when categories have similar proportions or when there are many categories.</li>

                <li>Why do we use counts and percentages (frequency tables and bar/pie charts) for a variable like 'preferred study method', but avoid calculating a "mean" or "standard deviation"? Consider the nature of this variable.</li>
                <li><strong>Task:</strong> Apply the steps from Sections 2.1 to 2.4 to the categorical variable `study_session_group`. Obtain its frequency table and plots in Stata.

        <div class="solution-section">
            <h4>Suggested Solutions for Reflection Questions (Part 2):</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>For 'preferred study method', "Flashcards" was the most frequently reported method, with a **Count of 36** participants, representing **36.0%** of the total sample.</li>
                <li>A **bar chart** would generally be more effective for conveying information clearly, especially for comparing the proportions of different study methods. This is because it is easier for the human eye to accurately compare the heights of bars than to compare the angles or areas of slices in a pie chart, particularly when the percentages are similar (as they are here).</li>
                <li>We avoid calculating a "mean" or "standard deviation" for 'preferred study method' because it is a **nominal categorical variable**. Its categories ("Flashcards", "Summarising", "Practice Tests") are simply labels; they do not represent quantities or have a numerical order. Therefore, performing mathematical operations like averaging these categories would be meaningless and illogical. Mean and standard deviation are statistics designed for numerical data.</li>
                <li><strong>Task Solution (for `study_session_group`):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Medium:</strong> Count = 36, Percent = 36.0%</li>
                        <li><strong>Low:</strong> Count = 33, Percent = 33.0%</li>
                        <li><strong>High:</strong> Count = 31, Percent = 31.0%</li>
                        <li><strong>Comparison:</strong> The distribution of study session groups is quite similar to preferred study methods in that all categories have a substantial proportion of participants. Both variables show a relatively even spread across their categories, though 'Medium' for study sessions is the most frequent, just as 'Flashcards' was for study methods.</li>

        <h2>Part 3: Descriptive Statistics by Groups (Splitting Data by Factors)</h2>
        <p>In data analysis, it is often insightful to understand if a numerical variable's distribution differs across distinct categories of another variable. This is known as "splitting" or "grouping" your data. For example, we might want to see if the final exam scores vary between students who used study support services and those who did not.</p>

        <h3>3.1 Analysing Interval/Ratio Variable by a Categorical Factor (e.g., final exam scores by used_study_support_services)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>With your <code>omni.dta</code> file open.</li>
            <li>To get summary statistics for a numerical variable for each group of a categorical variable:</li>
            <li>**Menu Driven:** Go to <code>Statistics > Summaries, tables, and tests > Summary and descriptive statistics > Summary statistics</code>. In the dialog box, move <code>final_exam_score</code> to the <code>Variables:</code> box. Then, move <code>used_study_support_services</code> to the <code>By/If/In:</code> box. Click on the <code>Details</code> tab and check <code>Display additional statistics (includes skewness and kurtosis)</code>. Click <code>OK</code>.</li>
            <li>**Command:** In the Command window, use the `bysort` prefix:
                <pre><code>
bysort used_study_support_services: summarize final_exam_score, detail
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                    The `bysort` prefix tells Stata to perform the subsequent command (here, `summarize final_exam_score, detail`) separately for each unique category of the `used_study_support_services` variable. This generates grouped summary statistics.
                </p>
            </li>
            <p>Stata will output separate summary tables for each group of 'used study support services'.</p>
            <li>To create grouped Box Plots (excellent for visual comparison):</li>
            <li>**Menu Driven:** Go to <code>Graphics > Box plot</code>. Move <code>final_exam_score</code> to the <code>Variable for y axis:</code> box. Then, move <code>used_study_support_services</code> to the <code>Categories (x axis):</code> box. Click <code>OK</code>.</li>
            <li>**Command:** In the Command window, type:
                <pre><code>
graph box final_exam_score, over(used_study_support_services)
                </code></pre>
                <p>
                    The `graph box` command creates box plots. The `over()` option specifies a categorical variable whose categories will be used to create separate box plots, allowing for easy visual comparison between groups.
                </p>
            </li>
            <p>Stata will generate the grouped box plot in a separate Graph window.</p>
        </ol>

        <h3>3.2 Interpreting Grouped Descriptive Statistics</h3>
        <p>By comparing the statistics and plots for each group, you can identify differences in the central tendency, spread, and shape of the numerical variable's distribution across your defined categories.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comparison of Means/Medians:</strong> Observe if the average exam scores are different for students who used support services compared to those who did not.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparison of Standard Deviations:</strong> Determine if the variability (consistency) in exam scores is different between the two groups. A larger standard deviation suggests more diverse scores within that group.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparison of Skewness/Kurtosis:</strong> Analyse if the shapes of the exam score distributions differ between the 'Yes' and 'No' groups (e.g., is one group's scores more skewed or more peaked?).</li>
            <li><strong>Box Plots:</strong> Visually compare the median lines, the size of the boxes (IQR), and the presence or absence of outliers between the groups. This provides a quick visual summary of potential group differences.</li>

What initial conclusion can you draw from this difference?</li>
                <li>Examine the standard deviations for both groups: 'Yes' (4.77) and 'No' (5.84). What does this difference imply about the consistency or variability of final exam scores within each group?</li>
                <li>Look closely at the grouped histograms or box plots. Do the distributions of final exam scores appear to have similar shapes (e.g., symmetry, spread, presence of outliers) for both groups, or are there noticeable visual differences that stand out?</li>
                <li><strong>Task:</strong> Conduct a similar analysis. Explore the numerical variable `quiz_score_post`, but this time, split it by the categorical variable `attended_peer_study_group`.

                <li>The mean final exam score for students who used study support services is 76.90, which is higher than the mean of 72.33 for students who did not use study support services. This suggests that, in this sample, students who utilised study support services tended to achieve higher final exam scores, on average.</li>
                <li>The standard deviation for the 'Yes' group (4.77) is smaller than for the 'No' group (5.84). This implies that final exam scores among students who used study support services were generally **more consistent** (less spread out) compared to those who did not use study support services. The scores in the 'Yes' group were more clustered around their mean.</li>

                        <li><strong>'No' Group:</strong> N=48, Mean=72.33, Median=72.00, StdDev=5.84, Min=60, Max=89, Skewness=0.31, Kurtosis=0.31. Mode: [68, 69, 71, 78] (multimodal).</li>
                        <li><strong>'Yes' Group:</strong> N=52, Mean=76.90, Median=76.00, StdDev=4.77, Min=68, Max=87, Skewness=0.20, Kurtosis=-0.56. Mode: [76].</li>
                    </ul>
                    Visually, the box plots will show that the 'Yes' group's distribution is centred at a higher score and its box (IQR) is narrower, indicating less variability. Both distributions appear relatively symmetrical, but the 'Yes' group might appear slightly flatter (more platykurtic) in its histogram, while the 'No' group is slightly more peaked.</li>
                <li><strong>Task Solution (for `quiz_score_post` split by `attended_peer_study_group`):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Students who DID NOT attend peer study group ('No' group):</strong> You might find a Mean of post-quiz scores of approximately 68.5 (SD ~7.2).</li>
                        <li><strong>Students who DID attend peer study group ('Yes' group):</strong> You might find a Mean of post-quiz scores of approximately 74.1 (SD ~6.5).</li>
                    </ul>
                    Based on these example numbers, students who attended peer study groups would tend to have a higher average post-quiz score and potentially slightly less variability in their scores compared to those who did not attend. This indicates a positive association between attending peer study groups and post-quiz performance in this sample.

            <h4>Write-Up Template for Grouped Interval/Ratio Variable (Example)</h4>
            <p>To compare final exam performance based on study support service usage, descriptive statistics for final exam scores were computed, split by study support service usage. Students who reported using study support services (N = 52) had a mean final exam score of 76.90 (SD = 4.77), a median of 76.00, and scores ranging from 68 to 87. In contrast, students who did not use study support services (N = 48) had a mean final exam score of 72.33 (SD = 5.84), a median of 72.00, and scores ranging from 60 to 89. This suggests that students utilising support services achieved, on average, higher and more consistent final exam scores. Further visual inspection of the grouped histograms and box plots provides additional insights into the distributions of scores for both groups. For instance, the 'Yes' group's distribution appears slightly narrower and centred at a higher score, with less variability than the 'No' group. Both distributions were relatively symmetrical, with the 'No' group having a skewness of 0.31 and kurtosis of 0.31, while the 'Yes' group had a skewness of 0.20 and kurtosis of -0.56.</p>

        <h2>Part 4: Using Stata Do-Files for Reproducible Analysis</h2>
        <p>A "do-file" in Stata is a text file containing a sequence of Stata commands. Running a do-file is like typing each command into the Command window one by one, but it allows you to automate your analysis, ensure reproducibility, and keep a clear record of your steps. This is a best practice in quantitative research.</p>

        <h3>4.1 Creating and Running a Do-File</h3>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Open a new Do-file Editor:</strong> In Stata, go to <code>Window > Do-file Editor > New Do-file Editor</code>, or click the "New Do-file Editor" icon on the toolbar (looks like a page with a pencil).</li>
            <li><strong>Copy Commands:</strong> Copy all the Stata commands provided below into the new Do-file Editor window.</li>
            <li><strong>Save the Do-file:</strong> Go to <code>File > Save As...</code> in the Do-file Editor. Save your do-file with a `.do` extension (e.g., `descriptive_stats_analysis.do`) in the same directory as your `omni.dta` file, or note its path.</li>
            <li><strong>Run the Do-file:</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>**To run specific lines:** Select the lines of code you want to run in the Do-file Editor, then click the "Execute (do)" icon (looks like a play button or a folder with a green arrow).</li>
                    <li>**To run the entire file:** Go to <code>Tools > Do</code> in the Do-file Editor menu, or type `do descriptive_stats_analysis.do` (replacing with your file name) in the main Stata Command window and press Enter.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <p>Running the do-file will execute all the commands, producing the same output and graphs as if you typed them manually, but much faster and more reliably.</p>
        </ol>

        <h3>4.2 Commands for Your Do-File</h3>
