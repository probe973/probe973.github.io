        <h1>Descriptive Statistics in R Studio</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">A Guide to Understanding and Summarizing Data</p>

        <p>This guide will walk you through the process of obtaining summary statistics and creating relevant graphs for different types of variables using R Studio. Understanding descriptive statistics is a foundational skill in data analysis, providing essential insights into the characteristics of your dataset.</p>

        <p>Descriptive statistics help us understand the basic features of the data in a study. They provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures, forming the basis of virtually every quantitative analysis.</p>

        <p>Before you begin, ensure you have your <code>omni.csv</code> file available. You can enter commands directly into the R Console (the bottom-left pane in R Studio by default) or by creating an R Script file (<code>File > New File > R Script</code>). Using an R Script file is recommended for saving your commands and making your work reproducible.</p>

        <p>In the code examples below, lines starting with `#` are comments. These are notes within the code that explain what the commands are doing. They are very useful for keeping track of your analysis steps in an R Script. If you are entering commands directly into the R Console, you do not need to copy the # or the comments after it.</p>

        <p>First, we need to load the data. We will use the `readr` package for this, which is part of the `tidyverse` collection of packages. If you don't have `readr` installed, you'll need to install it first. You only need to install a package once per R installation.</p>

        <p>Before loading your data, ensure your `omni.csv` file is in your R working directory. You can set your working directory using the R Studio menu: <code>Session > Set Working Directory > Choose Directory...</code></p>

        <pre><code>install.packages("readr") # Install readr package (only run once if not already installed)

library(readr) # Load readr package (run this line every time you start a new R session and want to use readr)

omni_data &lt;- read_csv("omni.csv") # This command reads the CSV file named "omni.csv" and stores it as a data frame called 'omni_data'.
                                 # The 'read_csv()' function is from the 'readr' package.
</code></pre>
        <p>Your data is now loaded into R and will be called `omni_data` (it was the name assigned to the left of the `<-` before the `read_csv` command). You will use `omni_data` to refer to your dataset in the commands.</p>
        <p>For more detailed instructions on loading data into R, please refer to the <a href="../loading_the_data/guide_r.html">Loading Data into R Guide</a>.</p>

        <p>Throughout this guide, we will use specific variables from your dataset to illustrate the concepts. You will also be prompted to apply the steps to other relevant variables:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>final_exam_score</code>: Represents the numerical score achieved by students on a final exam.</li>
            <li><code>study_hours_per_week</code>: Indicates the number of hours a student reported studying each week.</li>
            <li><code>preferred_study_method</code>: Describes a student's chosen study strategy (e.g., 'Summarizing', 'Practice Tests', 'Flashcards').</li>
            <li><code>study_session_group</code>: A categorical variable indicating the type of study session group a student was assigned to (e.g., 'High', 'Medium', 'Low').</li>
            <li><code>used_study_support_services</code>: A categorical variable indicating whether a student utilized study support services (Yes/No). This variable will be used to demonstrate splitting analyses by groups.</li>
        </ul>

        <hr>

        <h2>Part 1: Analyzing Interval/Ratio Variables</h2>
        <p>Interval/ratio variables are numerical variables where the differences between values are meaningful. For example, a 10-point difference in exam scores means the same regardless of the score range. Ratio variables also have a true zero point (e.g., age, income, test scores, study hours), where zero indicates an absence of the quantity. For these types of variables, we typically examine measures of central tendency (mean, median) and dispersion (standard deviation, variance, range).</p>

        <h3>1.1 Obtaining Summary Statistics for Interval/Ratio Variables (e.g., final_exam_score)</h3>
        <p>You can obtain individual descriptive statistics using base R functions, or get a comprehensive summary using the `psych` package.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Using Base R Functions (Individual Statistics):</strong>
                <p>To get basic statistics like mean and standard deviation for a variable like <code>final_exam_score</code>, you can use individual R functions. The <code>$</code> operator is used to select a specific column (variable) from a data frame.</p>
                <pre><code>mean(omni_data$final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE) # Calculates the mean, ignoring missing values
sd(omni_data$final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE)   # Calculates the standard deviation, ignoring missing values
median(omni_data$final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE) # Calculates the median, ignoring missing values
min(omni_data$final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE)   # Finds the minimum value
max(omni_data$final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE)   # Finds the maximum value
range(omni_data$final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE) # Finds the range (min and max)
var(omni_data$final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE)   # Calculates the variance
</code></pre>
                <p>The <code>na.rm = TRUE</code> argument is important as it tells R to remove any missing values (<code>NA</code>) before performing the calculation. If you don't include this, and your data has missing values, the result will often be <code>NA</code>.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Using the `psych` Package (Comprehensive Summary):</strong>
                <p>For a more comprehensive set of descriptive statistics, including N, mean, standard deviation, median, minimum, maximum, skewness, and kurtosis, we recommend using the <code>describe()</code> function from the <code>psych</code> package. If you don't have <code>psych</code> installed, you'll need to install it first.</p>
                <pre><code>install.packages("psych") # Install psych package (only run once if not already installed)

library(psych) # Load psych package (run this line every time you start a new R session)

describe(omni_data$final_exam_score) # Get descriptive statistics for 'final_exam_score'
</code></pre>
                <p>This command will output a table containing various descriptive statistics for the <code>final_exam_score</code> variable. The <code>describe()</code> function is particularly useful as it provides many common statistics in a single output.</p>
            </li>
        </ol>

        <h3>1.2 Interpreting Summary Statistics for Interval/Ratio Variables</h3>
        <p>Here's what each statistic (as provided by <code>psych::describe()</code>) tells us:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>vars:</strong> Variable number (index).</li>
            <li><strong>n:</strong> The total number of valid observations (N).</li>
            <li><strong>mean:</strong> The arithmetic average of all values. It is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of observations. It is sensitive to extreme values (outliers).</li>
            <li><strong>sd:</strong> Standard Deviation. A measure of the typical distance data points are from the mean. A smaller standard deviation indicates data points are clustered closely around the mean, while a larger one indicates more spread or variability in the data.</li>
            <li><strong>median:</strong> The middle value when data is ordered from smallest to largest. It is less affected by outliers than the mean.</li>
            <li><strong>trimmed:</strong> The mean after removing a certain percentage (usually 10%) of the smallest and largest values. This helps to reduce the influence of outliers.</li>
            <li><strong>mad:</strong> Median Absolute Deviation. A robust measure of statistical dispersion.</li>
            <li><strong>min:</strong> The smallest value observed in your dataset for that variable.</li>
            <li><strong>max:</strong> The largest value observed in your dataset for that variable.</li>
            <li><strong>range:</strong> The difference between the maximum and minimum values (Max - Min).</li>
            <li><strong>skew:</strong> Skewness. Indicates the symmetry of the distribution.
                <ul>
                    <li>If <strong>Skewness is close to 0</strong>, the distribution is relatively symmetrical.</li>
                    <li>If <strong>Skewness is positive (>0)</strong>, the tail of the distribution extends to the right (positive direction). The Mean > Median.</li>
                    <li>If <strong>Skewness is negative (<0)</strong>, the tail extends to the left (negative direction). The Mean < Median.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>kurtosis:</strong> Kurtosis. Indicates the "tailedness" or peakedness of the distribution compared to a normal distribution.
                <ul>
                    <li>If <strong>Kurtosis is positive (>0)</strong> (leptokurtic), it suggests heavier tails and a more peaked distribution, potentially indicating more outliers.</li>
                    <li>If <strong>Kurtosis is negative (<0)</strong> (platykurtic), it suggests lighter tails and a flatter distribution, with fewer extreme values than a normal distribution.</li>
                    <li>If <strong>Kurtosis is close to 0</strong> (mesokurtic), it resembles the tailedness and peakedness of a normal distribution.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Note: Different statistical software or R packages may use slightly different computational algorithms or default settings for calculating skewness and kurtosis. This can lead to minor variations in the reported numerical values, but the general interpretation of the shape (e.g., positive skew, platykurtic) remains consistent.</p>
            </li>
            <li><strong>se:</strong> Standard Error of the mean.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.3 Creating Graphs for Interval/Ratio Variables (Histograms & Box Plots)</h3>
        <p>Graphs provide powerful visual insights into the distribution of your data, complementing the numerical summaries.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>For Histograms:</strong>
                <p>Use the <code>hist()</code> function. This function creates a histogram of the specified numerical vector.
                <ul>
                    <li><code>main = "Histogram of Final Exam Scores"</code>: This argument sets the main title of the plot.</li>
                    <li><code>xlab = "Final Exam Score"</code>: This argument sets the label for the x-axis.</li>
                    <li><code>col = "lightblue"</code>: This argument sets the fill colour of the histogram bars.</li>

            <li><strong>Histogram:</strong> Displays the shape of the distribution, showing where values are concentrated, identifying peaks (modes), gaps, and overall symmetry or skewness. Each bar represents a range of values (or "bin"), and its height shows the frequency of scores within that range.</li>
            <li><strong>Box Plot:</strong> Provides a clear visual representation of the "five-number summary": minimum, first quartile (Q1), median (Q2), third quartile (Q3), and maximum. It is particularly effective for identifying outliers.
                <ul>
                    <li>The box itself represents the <strong>Interquartile Range (IQR)</strong>, which contains the middle 50% of your data (between Q1 and Q3).</li>
                    <li>The line inside the box is the <strong>median</strong>.</li>
                    <li>The "whiskers" typically extend to the most extreme data points within 1.5 times the IQR from the box.</li>
                    <li>Individual points (often shown as dots or asterisks) beyond the whiskers are considered <strong>outliers</strong>, specifically those falling more than 1.5 times the IQR below Q1 or above Q3. These points represent values unusually far from the rest of the data.</li>

            <ol>
                <li>For the final exam scores, compare the Mean (74.71) and Median (75.00). Based on the explanation of skewness in Section 1.2, what does the relationship between these two values suggest about the symmetry of the final exam score distribution?</li>
                <li>Consider the Skewness value (0.00) and Kurtosis value (-0.24) for the final exam scores. How do these numerical values, along with the visual information from the histogram, help you describe the overall shape of this distribution? Is it symmetrical, and does it appear peaked or relatively flat compared to a typical bell curve?</li>
                <li>Examine the box plot for the final exam scores. Do you see any individual points plotted outside the main "whiskers" of the box plot? If so, what do these points represent in the context of our data?</li>
                <li><strong>Task:</strong> Now, apply the steps from Sections 1.1 to 1.4 to the variable `study_hours_per_week` in your R Studio environment. What are its mean, median, and standard deviation?</li>

            <ol>
                <li>For the final exam scores, the Mean (74.71) and Median (75.00) are very close. This indicates that the distribution of final exam scores is quite <strong>symmetrical</strong>, as neither the mean nor the median is significantly pulled in one direction by extreme values.</li>
                <li>The Skewness value of 0.00 suggests that the distribution of final exam scores is almost perfectly symmetrical. A Kurtosis value of -0.24, which is negative, indicates that the distribution is slightly <strong>platykurtic</strong> (a bit flatter than a normal distribution), meaning it has slightly lighter tails and fewer extreme values. The histogram should visually confirm this: a roughly bell-shaped curve with no pronounced long tail on either side.</li>
                <li>For the final exam scores, the box plot <strong>does not show any individual points</strong> beyond the whiskers. This signifies that there are no statistical <strong>outliers</strong> detected in this dataset for final exam scores, based on the 1.5 IQR rule. If points were present, they would represent unusually high or low scores compared to the majority of the data.</li>

        <h2>Part 2: Analyzing Categorical Variables</h2>
        <p>Categorical variables represent types of data which can be divided into groups or categories. This includes nominal variables (categories without inherent order, e.g., 'preferred study method', where 'Flashcards' is not "better" or "more" than 'Summarizing') and ordinal variables (categories with a meaningful order, e.g., satisfaction ratings like 'Low', 'Medium', 'High'). For these types of variables, we focus on frequencies and proportions rather than means and standard deviations, as these mathematical operations are not meaningful for non-numerical categories.</p>

        <h3>2.1 Obtaining Frequency Tables for Categorical Variables (e.g., preferred_study_method)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>To get a frequency table for a categorical variable like <code>preferred_study_method</code>, use the <code>table()</code> function. This will give you the counts for each category.</li>
            <pre><code>table(omni_data$preferred_study_method)</code></pre>
            <li>To get percentages (proportions), you can use the <code>prop.table()</code> function on the result of <code>table()</code>. Multiplying by 100 gives percentages.</li>
            <pre><code>prop.table(table(omni_data$preferred_study_method)) * 100</code></pre>
            <p>These commands will output the counts and percentages for each category of the `preferred_study_method` variable, respectively. These are the standard ways to display frequency distributions for categorical data in R.</p>
        </ol>

        <h3>2.2 Interpreting Frequency Tables for Categorical Variables</h3>
        <p>A frequency table lists each category of your variable and shows how many times it appears in your data (Count or Frequency) and its proportion relative to the total (Percent or Percentage).</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>

        <h3>2.3 Creating Graphs for Categorical Variables (Bar Charts)</h3>
        <p>Graphs provide powerful visual insights into the distribution of your data, complementing the numerical summaries.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>To create a bar chart for a categorical variable like <code>preferred_study_method</code>, first create a frequency table using <code>table()</code>, and then pass this table to the <code>barplot()</code> function.
                <p>Use the <code>barplot()</code> function. This function creates a bar plot of the specified data (typically a frequency table).
                <ul>
                    <li><code>method_counts <- table(omni_data$preferred_study_method)</code>: This line first creates a frequency table of the `preferred_study_method` variable and stores it in an object called `method_counts`. This table is then passed to the `barplot()` function.</li>
                    <li><code>main = "Bar Chart of Preferred Study Methods"</code>: This argument sets the main title of the plot.</li>
                    <li><code>xlab = "Study Method"</code>: This argument sets the label for the x-axis.</li>
                    <li><code>ylab = "Frequency"</code>: This argument sets the label for the y-axis.</li>
                    <li><code>col = c("coral", "lightgreen", "skyblue")</code>: This argument sets the fill colours for the bars. You can provide a vector of colours to assign a different colour to each bar.</li>
                    <li><code>border = "black"</code>: This argument sets the colour of the borders around the bars.</li>
                </ul>

            <pre><code>method_counts <- table(omni_data$preferred_study_method) # Create a frequency table

barplot(method_counts,
        main = "Bar Chart of Preferred Study Methods", # Title of the bar chart
        xlab = "Study Method",                       # Label for the x-axis
        ylab = "Frequency",                          # Label for the y-axis

        <h3>2.4 Interpreting Graphs for Categorical Variables</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bar Chart:</strong> Each bar represents a distinct category, and its height (or length) corresponds to the frequency or percentage of observations in that category. Bar charts are generally preferred over pie charts for clarity and ease of comparison, especially when comparing frequencies across multiple categories or when categories have similar proportions.</li>

        <h2>Part 3: Descriptive Statistics by Groups (Splitting Data by Factors)</h2>
        <p>In data analysis, it is often insightful to understand if a numerical variable's distribution differs across distinct categories of another variable. This is known as "splitting" or "grouping" your data. For example, we might want to see if the final exam scores vary between students who used study support services and those who did not.</p>

        <h3>3.1 Analyzing Interval/Ratio Variable by a Categorical Factor (e.g., final exam scores by used_study_support_services)</h3>
        <p>To obtain descriptive statistics for a numerical variable, grouped by a categorical variable, you have two main approaches: using the <code>describeBy()</code> function from the <code>psych</code> package (simpler for direct summaries) or using the <code>dplyr</code> package with its powerful piping capabilities (more flexible for custom summaries and data manipulation).</p>

        <h4>Method 1: Using `psych::describeBy()`</h4>
        <p>The <code>describeBy()</code> function from the <code>psych</code> package is specifically designed for this type of grouped analysis and provides a comprehensive set of statistics for each group in a single step.</p>
        <p>Use the <code>describeBy()</code> function with the following arguments:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>x</code>: This is the numerical variable you want to describe (e.g., <code>omni_data$final_exam_score</code>).</li>
            <li><code>group</code>: This is the categorical variable by which you want to split or group your data (e.g., <code>omni_data$used_study_support_services</code>).</li>
            <li><code>mat = TRUE</code>: This argument ensures the output is presented in a matrix (table) format, which is typically easier to read and interpret.</li>
            <li><code>digits = 2</code>: This argument rounds the numerical output to 2 decimal places for cleaner presentation.</li>
        </ul>
        <pre><code>describeBy(x = omni_data$final_exam_score,
           group = omni_data$used_study_support_services,
           mat = TRUE,
           digits = 2)
</code></pre>
        <p>This command will produce a table showing the descriptive statistics (mean, median, SD, skew, kurtosis, etc.) for <code>final_exam_score</code> separately for each level of <code>used_study_support_services</code> ('No' and 'Yes').</p>

        <h4>Method 2: Using `dplyr` (Flexible for Custom Summaries)</h4>
        <p>The <code>dplyr</code> package (part of the <code>tidyverse</code>) is a powerful tool for data manipulation in R. It uses a concept called "piping" (<code>%>%</code>), which allows you to chain commands together in a very readable and logical flow. It's like saying "take this data, THEN do this, THEN do that." If you don't have <code>dplyr</code> installed, you'll need to install it first.</p>
        <pre><code>install.packages("dplyr") # Install dplyr package (only run once if not already installed)

library(dplyr) # Load dplyr package (run this line every time you start a new R session)

omni_data %>%
  group_by(used_study_support_services) %>%
  summarise(
    N = n(),
    Mean = mean(final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE),
    Median = median(final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE),
    SD = sd(final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE),
    Min = min(final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE),
    Max = max(final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE),
    Skewness = psych::skew(final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE),
    Kurtosis = psych::kurtosi(final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE)
  )
</code></pre>
        <p>Let's break down what each part of this <code>dplyr</code> command does:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>omni_data %>%</code>: This starts the "pipe." It takes your <code>omni_data</code> data frame and passes it as the first argument to the next function (<code>group_by()</code>). The <code>%>%</code> operator can be read as "then."</li>
            <li><code>group_by(used_study_support_services)</code>: This function groups the data by the <code>used_study_support_services</code> variable. Any subsequent operations (like <code>summarise()</code>) will then be applied separately to each unique category within this grouping variable (e.g., 'Yes' and 'No').</li>
            <li><code>summarise(...)</code>: This function creates new summary variables (columns) for each group. Inside <code>summarise()</code>, you define the new column names and the calculations for them:
                <ul>
                    <li><code>N = n()</code>: Calculates the number of observations (count) for each group. <code>n()</code> is a <code>dplyr</code> specific function to get the count.</li>
                    <li><code>Mean = mean(final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE)</code>: Calculates the mean of <code>final_exam_score</code> for each group, ignoring missing values.</li>
                    <li><code>Median = median(final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE)</code>: Calculates the median of <code>final_exam_score</code> for each group, ignoring missing values.</li>
                    <li><code>SD = sd(final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE)</code>: Calculates the standard deviation of <code>final_exam_score</code> for each group, ignoring missing values.</li>
                    <li><code>Min = min(final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE)</code>: Finds the minimum value of <code>final_exam_score</code> for each group.</li>
                    <li><code>Max = max(final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE)</code>: Finds the maximum value of <code>final_exam_score</code> for each group.</li>
                    <li><code>Skewness = psych::skew(final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE)</code>: Calculates the skewness of <code>final_exam_score</code> for each group. Note the <code>psych::</code> prefix, which ensures R uses the <code>skew</code> function from the <code>psych</code> package.</li>
                    <li><code>Kurtosis = psych::kurtosi(final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE)</code>: Calculates the kurtosis of <code>final_exam_score</code> for each group. Again, <code>psych::</code> specifies the package.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>When you run this entire block of code, the result will be a table showing the requested summary statistics for <code>final_exam_score</code>, broken down by <code>used_study_support_services</code>.</p>

        <h4>Creating Grouped Graphs</h4>
        <p>For creating grouped histograms and box plots, <code>ggplot2</code> is highly recommended for its flexibility and aesthetic quality. If you don't have <code>ggplot2</code> installed, you'll need to install it first.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Install and load the <code>ggplot2</code> package:
            <pre><code>install.packages("ggplot2") # Install ggplot2 package (only run once if not already installed)

library(ggplot2) # Load ggplot2 package (run this line every time you start a new R session)</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li><strong>For Grouped Histograms:</strong>

        <h3>3.2 Interpreting Grouped Descriptive Statistics</h3>
        <p>By comparing the statistics and plots for each group, you can identify differences in the central tendency, spread, and shape of the numerical variable's distribution across your defined categories.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comparison of Means/Medians:</strong> Observe if the average exam scores are different for students who used support services compared to those who did not.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparison of Standard Deviations:</strong> Determine if the variability (consistency) in exam scores is different between the two groups. A larger standard deviation suggests more diverse scores within that group.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparison of Skewness/Kurtosis:</strong> Analyze if the shapes of the exam score distributions differ between the 'Yes' and 'No' groups (e.g., is one group's scores more skewed or more peaked?).</li>
            <li><strong>Box Plots:</strong> Visually compare the median lines, the size of the boxes (IQR), and the presence or absence of outliers between the groups. This provides a quick visual summary of potential group differences.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="reflection-question">
            <h4>Reflection Questions & Tasks:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Based on the grouped descriptive statistics for final exam scores when split by <code>used_study_support_services</code>, what is the mean final exam score for students who used support services compared to those who did not? What initial conclusion can you draw from this difference?</li>
                <li>Examine the standard deviations for both groups: 'Yes' (4.77) and 'No' (5.84). What does this difference imply about the consistency or variability of final exam scores within each group?</li>
                <li>Look closely at the grouped histograms or box plots. Do the distributions of final exam scores appear to have similar shapes (e.g., symmetry, spread, presence of outliers) for both groups, or are there noticeable visual differences that stand out?</li>
                <li><strong>Task:</strong> Conduct a similar analysis. Explore the numerical variable <code>quiz_score_post</code>, but this time, split it by the categorical variable <code>attended_peer_study_group</code>. What patterns do you observe regarding their post-quiz scores?</li>

            <h4>Suggested Solutions for Reflection Questions (Part 3):</h4>
            <p>Based on the `psych::describeBy()` output and the images you provided:</p>
            <ol>
                <li>The mean final exam score for students who used study support services is 76.90, which is higher than the mean of 72.33 for students who did not use support services. This suggests that, in this sample, students who utilized study support services tended to achieve higher final exam scores, on average.</li>
                <li>The standard deviation for the 'Yes' group (4.77) is smaller than for the 'No' group (5.84). This implies that final exam scores among students who used study support services were generally <strong>more consistent</strong> (less spread out) compared to those who did not use study support services. The scores in the 'Yes' group were more clustered around their mean.</li>
                <li>For final exam scores split by <code>used_study_support_services</code>:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>'No' Group:</strong> N=48, Mean=72.33, Median=72.00, StdDev=5.84, Min=60, Max=89, Skewness=0.29, Kurtosis=0.03.</li>
                        <li><strong>'Yes' Group:</strong> N=52, Mean=76.90, Median=76.00, StdDev=4.77, Min=68, Max=87, Skewness=0.19, Kurtosis=-0.71.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Visually, the box plots will show that the 'Yes' group's distribution is centered at a higher score and its box (IQR) is narrower, indicating less variability. Both distributions appear relatively symmetrical, but the 'Yes' group shows a more pronounced platykurtic (flatter) shape with a kurtosis of -0.71, while the 'No' group's kurtosis of 0.03 is closer to a normal distribution.</li>
                <li><strong>Task Solution (for <code>quiz_score_post</code> split by <code>attended_peer_study_group</code>):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Students who DID NOT attend peer study group ('No' group):</strong> N=47, Mean=71.32, Median=71, SD=8.63, Minimum=50, Maximum=88, Skewness=-0.29, Kurtosis=-0.27.</li>
                        <li><strong>Students who DID attend peer study group ('Yes' group):</strong> N=53, Mean=70.75, Median=71, SD=10.62, Minimum=49, Maximum=95, Skewness=-0.14, Kurtosis=-0.54.</li>
                    </ul>
                    Based on these numbers, students who attended peer study groups ('Yes' group) had a slightly lower mean post-quiz score (70.75) compared to those who did not attend ('No' group, 71.32). The 'Yes' group also shows a larger standard deviation (10.62 vs 8.63), indicating more variability in their post-quiz scores. Both distributions appear slightly negatively skewed and platykurtic, with the 'Yes' group showing a slightly more platykurtic shape. This suggests that in this sample, attending peer study groups did not lead to higher average post-quiz scores and was associated with more varied performance.

            <h4>Write-Up Template for Grouped Interval/Ratio Variable (Example)</h4>
            <p>To compare final exam performance based on study support service usage, descriptive statistics for final exam scores were computed, split by study support service usage. Students who reported using study support services (N = 52) had a mean final exam score of 76.90 (SD = 4.77), a median of 76.00, and scores ranging from 68 to 87. In contrast, students who did not use study support services (N = 48) had a mean final exam score of 72.33 (SD = 5.84), a median of 72.00, and scores ranging from 60 to 89. This suggests that students utilizing support services achieved, on average, higher and more consistent final exam scores. Further visual inspection of the grouped histograms and box plots provides additional insights into the distributions of scores for both groups. For instance, the 'Yes' group's distribution appears slightly narrower and centered at a higher score, with less variability than the 'No' group. Both distributions were relatively symmetrical, with the 'No' group having a skewness of 0.29 and kurtosis of 0.03, while the 'Yes' group had a skewness of 0.19 and kurtosis = -0.71.</p>
