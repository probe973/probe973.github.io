        <h1>Descriptive Statistics in R Studio</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">A Guide to Understanding and Summarizing Data using R</p>

        <p>This guide will walk you through the process of obtaining summary statistics and creating relevant graphs for different types of variables using R Studio. Understanding descriptive statistics is a foundational skill in data analysis, providing essential insights into the characteristics of your dataset.</p>

        <p>Descriptive statistics help us understand the basic features of the data in a study. They provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures, forming the basis of virtually every quantitative analysis.</p>

        <p>Before you begin, ensure you have your <code>omni.csv</code> file available. Throughout this guide, we will use specific variables from your dataset to illustrate the concepts. You will also be prompted to apply the steps to other relevant variables:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>final_exam_score</code>: Represents the numerical score achieved by students on a final exam.</li>
            <li><code>study_hours_per_week</code>: Indicates the number of hours a student reported studying each week.</li>
            <li><code>preferred_study_method</code>: Describes a student's chosen study strategy (e.g., 'Flashcards', 'Summarizing', 'Practice Tests').</li>
            <li><code>study_session_group</code>: A categorical variable indicating the type of study session group a student was assigned to (e.g., 'High', 'Medium', 'Low').</li>
            <li><code>used_study_support_services</code>: A categorical variable indicating whether a student utilized study support services (Yes/No). This variable will be used to demonstrate splitting analyses by groups.</li>
        </ul>
        <p>To follow along, first load your data into R. Assuming <code>omni.csv</code> is in your working directory:</p>
        <pre><code>
data <- read.csv("omni.csv")
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            The `read.csv()` function is used to load data from a CSV (Comma Separated Values) file into a data frame in R. In this command, `"omni.csv"` is the path to your file. The loaded data will be stored in an object named `data`.
        </p>
        <pre><code>
head(data)
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            The `head()` function displays the first six rows of a data frame (or other R objects) by default. This is useful for quickly checking the structure and content of your loaded data.
        </p>

        <hr>

        <h2>Part 1: Analyzing Interval/Ratio Variables</h2>
        <p>Interval/ratio variables are numerical variables where the differences between values are meaningful. For example, a 10-point difference in exam scores means the same regardless of the score range. Ratio variables also have a true zero point (e.g., age, income, test scores, study hours), where zero indicates an absence of the quantity. For these types of variables, we typically examine measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (standard deviation, variance, range).</p>

        <h3>1.1 Obtaining Summary Statistics for Interval/Ratio Variables (e.g., final_exam_score)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Load your <code>omni.csv</code> file into an R data frame as shown above.</li>
            <li>To get a quick summary of a numerical variable, use the <code>summary()</code> function. This provides minimum, 1st quartile, median, mean, 3rd quartile, and maximum.</li>
            <pre><code>
summary(data$final_exam_score)
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                The `summary()` function provides a concise statistical summary. `data$final_exam_score` refers to accessing the `final_exam_score` column within your `data` data frame. The `$` operator is used to select a specific variable (column) from a data frame.
            </p>
            <p>Example Output (your exact values might vary slightly based on data):</p>
            <pre><code>
   Min. 1st Qu.  Median    Mean 3rd Qu.    Max.
  60.00   70.00   75.00   74.71   79.00   89.00
            </code></pre>
            <li>To get other statistics like standard deviation, variance, skewness, and kurtosis, you can use individual functions. For skewness and kurtosis, you might need to install and load the `psych` package if you haven't already.</li>
            <pre><code>
# To install the 'psych' package (run this line only once)
# install.packages("psych")

# To load the 'psych' package (run this line every time you start a new R session and want to use it)
library(psych)
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                `install.packages("psych")` downloads and installs the 'psych' package from CRAN (Comprehensive R Archive Network). You only need to run this command once on your computer. `library(psych)` loads the installed 'psych' package into your current R session, making its functions available for use. You need to run `library()` every time you start a new R session and wish to use functions from that package.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
mean(data$final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE)
median(data$final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE)
sd(data$final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE)
var(data$final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE)
min(data$final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE)
max(data$final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE)
skew(data$final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE)
kurtosi(data$final_exam_score, na.rm = TRUE)
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                These are standard R functions for calculating descriptive statistics:
                <ul>
                    <li>`mean()` calculates the arithmetic mean.</li>
                    <li>`median()` calculates the median.</li>
                    <li>`sd()` calculates the standard deviation.</li>
                    <li>`var()` calculates the variance.</li>
                    <li>`min()` finds the smallest value.</li>
                    <li>`max()` finds the largest value.</li>
                </ul>
                The argument `na.rm = TRUE` is used with all these functions to tell R to remove any missing values (Not Available, `NA`) from the calculation. If missing values are present and `na.rm = TRUE` is omitted, the function would return `NA`.
                The `skew()` and `kurtosi()` functions (note the 'i' at the end for kurtosis) are from the `psych` package and calculate the skewness and kurtosis of the distribution, respectively.
            </p>
            <p>Example Output (for individual stats):</p>
            <pre><code>
# Mean
[1] 74.71

# Median

        <h3>1.2 Interpreting Summary Statistics for Interval/Ratio Variables</h3>
        <p>Here's what each statistic tells us:</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>N &amp; Missing:</strong> R's `summary()` function and other functions often remove `NA` (Not Available) values by default or with `na.rm = TRUE`. You can check missing values with `sum(is.na(data$variable_name))`.</li>
            <li><strong>Mean:</strong> The arithmetic average of all values. It is calculated by summing all values and dividing by the number of observations. The mean is sensitive to extreme values (outliers), meaning it can be pulled towards very high or very low scores.</li>
            <li><strong>Median:</strong> The middle value when data is ordered from smallest to largest. If there's an even number of observations, it's the average of the two middle values. The median is less affected by outliers than the mean, making it a good measure of typical value in skewed distributions.</li>
            <li><strong>Mode:</strong> The value that appears most frequently in the dataset. A dataset can have one mode, multiple modes (bimodal or multimodal), or no mode if all values occur with the same frequency. R does not have a built-in `mode()` function for numerical data in the statistical sense (it refers to storage mode). You'd typically infer this from a histogram or write a custom function.</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Deviation (`sd()`):</strong> A measure of the typical distance data points are from the mean. A smaller standard deviation indicates data points are clustered closely around the mean, while a larger one indicates more spread or variability in the data.</li>
            <li><strong>Variance (`var()`):</strong> The average of the squared differences from the Mean. It is the square of the standard deviation. It gives a numerical value describing the spread of data points.</li>
            <li><strong>Minimum (`min()`) &amp; Maximum (`max()`):</strong> The smallest and largest values observed in your dataset for that variable. This gives you the range of your data.</li>
            <li><strong>Skewness (`skew()` from `psych` package):</strong> Indicates the symmetry of the distribution.
                <ul>
                    <li>If **Skewness is close to 0**, the distribution is relatively symmetrical (e.g., a bell curve). In symmetrical distributions, the mean, median, and mode are often very close to each other.</li>
                    <li>If **Skewness is positive (>0)**, the tail of the distribution extends to the right (positive direction). This typically means there are more lower values, with a few higher, extreme values pulling the mean to the right of the median. In this case, the Mean > Median.</li>
                    <li>If **Skewness is negative (<0)**, the tail extends to the left (negative direction). This typically means there are more higher values, with a few lower, extreme values pulling the mean to the left of the median. In this case, the Mean < Median.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Kurtosis (`kurtosi()` from `psych` package):</strong> Indicates the "tailedness" or peakedness of the distribution compared to a normal distribution.
                <ul>
                    <li>If **Kurtosis is positive (>0)** (leptokurtic), it suggests heavier tails and a more peaked distribution, potentially indicating more outliers (extreme values).</li>
                    <li>If **Kurtosis is negative (<0)** (platykurtic), it suggests lighter tails and a flatter distribution, with fewer extreme values than a normal distribution.</li>
                    <li>If **Kurtosis is close to 0** (mesokurtic), it resembles the tailedness and peakedness of a normal distribution.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.3 Creating Graphs for Interval/Ratio Variables (Histograms & Box Plots)</h3>
        <p>Graphs provide powerful visual insights into the distribution of your data, complementing the numerical summaries. In R, plots will appear in the "Plots" pane of R Studio.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use `hist()` for histograms and `boxplot()` for box plots.</li>
            <pre><code>
hist(data$final_exam_score,
     main = "Histogram of Final Exam Scores",
     xlab = "Final Exam Score",
     ylab = "Frequency",
     col = "steelblue",
     border = "white")
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                The `hist()` function creates a histogram.
                <ul>
                    <li>The first argument, `data$final_exam_score`, specifies the numerical variable for which to create the histogram.</li>
                    <li>`main` sets the title of the plot.</li>
                    <li>`xlab` sets the label for the x-axis.</li>
                    <li>`ylab` sets the label for the y-axis.</li>
                    <li>`col` sets the fill color of the bars.</li>
                    <li>`border` sets the color of the borders around the bars.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <pre><code>
boxplot(data$final_exam_score,
        main = "Box Plot of Final Exam Scores",
        ylab = "Final Exam Score",
        col = "lightgreen",
        border = "darkgreen")
            </code></pre>
            <p>

            <li><strong>Histogram:</strong> Displays the shape of the distribution, showing where values are concentrated, identifying peaks (modes), gaps, and overall symmetry or skewness. Each bar represents a range of values (or "bin"), and its height shows the frequency of scores within that range.</li>
            <li><strong>Box Plot:</strong> Provides a clear visual representation of the "five-number summary": minimum, first quartile (Q1), median (Q2), third quartile (Q3), and maximum. It is particularly effective for identifying outliers.
                <ul>
                    <li>The box itself represents the **Interquartile Range (IQR)**, which contains the middle 50% of your data (between Q1 and Q3).</li>

                    <li>The "whiskers" typically extend to the most extreme data points within 1.5 times the IQR from the box.</li>
                    <li>Individual points (often shown as dots or asterisks) beyond the whiskers are considered **outliers**, meaning they are unusually far from the rest of the data.</li>

            <h4>Reflection Questions & Tasks:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>For the final exam scores, compare the Mean (output from `mean()`) and Median (output from `median()`). Based on the explanation of skewness in Section 1.2, what does the relationship between these two values suggest about the symmetry of the final exam score distribution?</li>
                <li>Consider the Skewness value (output from `skew()`) and Kurtosis value (output from `kurtosi()`) for the final exam scores. How do these numerical values, along with the visual information from the histogram, help you describe the overall shape of this distribution? Is it symmetrical, and does it appear peaked or relatively flat compared to a typical bell curve?</li>
                <li>Examine the box plot for the final exam scores. Do you see any individual points plotted outside the main "whiskers" of the box plot? If so, what do these points represent in the context of our data?</li>
                <li><strong>Task:</strong> Now, apply the steps from Sections 1.1 to 1.4 to the variable `study_hours_per_week` in R. What are its mean, median, and standard deviation? How does its distribution (shape, spread, symmetry) compare to that of the final exam scores, both numerically and visually?</li>

        <div class="solution-section">
            <h4>Suggested Solutions for Reflection Questions (Part 1):</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>For the final exam scores, the Mean (74.71) and Median (75.00) are very close. This indicates that the distribution of final exam scores is quite **symmetrical**, as neither the mean nor the median is significantly pulled in one direction by extreme values.</li>
                <li>The Skewness value of 0.00 suggests that the distribution of final exam scores is almost perfectly symmetrical. A Kurtosis value of -0.13, which is close to 0 but slightly negative, indicates that the distribution is slightly **platykurtic** (a bit flatter than a normal distribution), meaning it has slightly lighter tails and fewer extreme values. The histogram should visually confirm this: a roughly bell-shaped curve with no pronounced long tail on either side.</li>
                <li>For the final exam scores, the box plot **does not show any individual points** beyond the whiskers. This signifies that there are no statistical **outliers** detected in this dataset for final exam scores, based on the 1.5 IQR rule. If points were present, they would represent unusually high or low scores compared to the majority of the data.</li>

                        <li><strong>Skewness:</strong> 0.38 (Slightly positively skewed - the tail extends slightly to the right, meaning a few students study a lot more hours).</li>
                        <li><strong>Kurtosis:</strong> 0.07 (Very slightly leptokurtic, near normal peakedness, suggesting the tails are not excessively heavy or light).</li>
                        <li>**Comparison:** Compared to the final exam scores, the study hours per week variable has a larger standard deviation (7.39 vs. 5.76), indicating more variability in the reported study hours among students. While the final exam scores distribution is highly symmetrical, the study hours per week variable shows a slight positive skew (Mean 19.28 > Median 18.50), indicating a slight tendency for more students to study fewer hours, with a tail extending towards higher study hours.</li>

        <h2>Part 2: Analyzing Categorical Variables</h2>
        <p>Categorical variables represent types of data which can be divided into groups or categories. This includes nominal variables (categories without inherent order, e.g., 'preferred study method') and ordinal variables (categories with a meaningful order, e.g., satisfaction ratings like 'Low', 'Medium', 'High'). For categorical variables, we focus on frequencies and proportions rather than means and standard deviations, as these mathematical operations are not meaningful for non-numerical categories.</p>

        <h3>2.1 Obtaining Frequency Tables for Categorical Variables (e.g., preferred_study_method)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Load your <code>omni.csv</code> file into an R data frame.</li>
            <li>To get frequency counts and percentages for a categorical variable, use the `table()` and `prop.table()` functions.</li>
            <pre><code>
data$preferred_study_method <- as.factor(data$preferred_study_method)
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                The `as.factor()` function converts a variable into a factor (R's term for a categorical variable). This is crucial for R to correctly interpret and handle categorical data in many functions, ensuring it doesn't treat categories as numbers.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
counts <- table(data$preferred_study_method)
print(counts)
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                The `table()` function generates a frequency table, showing the count of observations for each unique value (category) of the specified variable.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
percentages <- prop.table(counts) * 100
print(percentages)
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                The `prop.table()` function converts a frequency table (like `counts`) into a table of proportions. Multiplying the result by `100` converts these proportions into percentages, making them easier to interpret.
            </p>
            <p>Example Output:</p>
            <pre><code>
# Counts
Flashcards Practice Tests   Summarizing
        36            31            33

# Percentages
Flashcards Practice Tests   Summarizing
      36.0          31.0          33.0
            </code></pre>
        </ol>

        <h3>2.2 Interpreting Frequency Tables for Categorical Variables</h3>

        <h3>2.3 Creating Graphs for Categorical Variables (Bar Charts & Pie Charts)</h3>
        <p>Bar charts and pie charts are effective ways to visually represent the distribution of categorical variables. Remember to run the `table()` function first to get the counts.</p>
        <ol>
            <li>Use `barplot()` for bar charts and `pie()` for pie charts.</li>

        border = "darkblue")
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                The `barplot()` function creates a bar chart.
                <ul>
                    <li>The first argument, `counts`, is the table of frequencies you created.</li>
                    <li>`main` sets the title of the plot.</li>
                    <li>`xlab` sets the label for the x-axis (categories).</li>
                    <li>`ylab` sets the label for the y-axis (counts).</li>
                    <li>`col` sets the fill colors for each bar. You can provide a vector of colors, one for each bar.</li>
                    <li>`border` sets the color of the borders around the bars.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <pre><code>
pie(counts,

            </code></pre>
            <p>
                The `pie()` function creates a pie chart.
                <ul>
                    <li>The first argument, `counts`, is the table of frequencies.</li>
                    <li>`main` sets the title of the plot.</li>
                    <li>`col` sets the fill colors for each slice.</li>
                    <li>`labels` provides the text labels for each slice. The `paste0()` function concatenates strings without a separator, and `names(counts)` gets the names of the categories from your `counts` table. This creates labels like "Flashcards (36.0%)".</li>
                </ul>

        <h3>2.4 Interpreting Graphs for Categorical Variables</h3>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bar Chart:</strong> Each bar represents a distinct category, and its height (or length) corresponds to the frequency or percentage of observations in that category. Bar charts are generally preferred over pie charts for clarity and ease of comparison, especially when comparing frequencies across multiple categories or when categories have similar proportions.</li>
            <li><strong>Pie Chart:</strong> The entire circle represents 100% of the data, and each slice represents a category's proportion of the whole. While visually intuitive for showing parts of a whole, it can be challenging to accurately compare the sizes of slices when categories have similar proportions or when there are many categories.</li>

        <div class="solution-section">
            <h4>Suggested Solutions for Reflection Questions (Part 2):</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>For 'preferred study method', "Flashcards" was the most frequently reported method, with a **Count of 36** participants, representing **36.0%** of the total sample.</li>
                <li>A **bar chart** would generally be more effective for conveying information clearly, especially for comparing the proportions of different study methods. This is because it is easier for the human eye to accurately compare the heights of bars than to compare the angles or areas of slices in a pie chart, particularly when the percentages are similar (as they are here).</li>
                <li>We avoid calculating a "mean" or "standard deviation" for 'preferred study method' because it is a **nominal categorical variable**. Its categories ("Flashcards", "Summarizing", "Practice Tests") are simply labels; they do not represent quantities or have a numerical order. Therefore, performing mathematical operations like averaging these categories would be meaningless and illogical. Mean and standard deviation are statistics designed for numerical data.</li>
                <li><strong>Task Solution (for `study_session_group`):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Medium:</strong> Count = 36, Percent = 36.0%</li>

                        <li><strong>High:</strong> Count = 31, Percent = 31.0%</li>
                        <li><strong>Comparison:</strong> The distribution of study session groups is quite similar to preferred study methods in that all categories have a substantial proportion of participants. Both variables show a relatively even spread across their categories, though 'Medium' for study sessions is the most frequent, just as 'Flashcards' was for study methods.</li>

        <h2>Part 3: Descriptive Statistics by Groups (Splitting Data by Factors)</h2>
        <p>In data analysis, it is often insightful to understand if a numerical variable's distribution differs across distinct categories of another variable. This is known as "splitting" or "grouping" your data. For example, we might want to see if the final exam scores vary between students who used study support services and those who did not.</p>

        <h3>3.1 Analyzing Interval/Ratio Variable by a Categorical Factor (e.g., final exam scores by used_study_support_services)</h3>
        <ol>
            <li>Load your <code>omni.csv</code> file into an R data frame.</li>
            <li>To calculate descriptive statistics for a numerical variable grouped by a categorical variable, you can use the `aggregate()` function.</li>
            <pre><code>
data$used_study_support_services <- as.factor(data$used_study_support_services)
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                Similar to the previous section, this line ensures that the `used_study_support_services` column is treated as a categorical factor by R, which is necessary for grouping.
            </p>
            <pre><code>
aggregate(final_exam_score ~ used_study_support_services, data = data, FUN = mean, na.rm = TRUE)
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                The `aggregate()` function applies a function (`FUN`) to a numerical variable, grouped by categories of another variable.
                <ul>
                    <li>`final_exam_score ~ used_study_support_services` is a formula. In R formulas, `~` means "explained by" or "grouped by." So, this reads as "final exam score grouped by used study support services."</li>
                    <li>`data = data` specifies the data frame where these variables are located.</li>
                    <li>`FUN = mean` specifies that the `mean()` function should be applied to each group. You can replace `mean` with `median`, `sd`, `min`, `max`, or any other function.</li>
                    <li>`na.rm = TRUE` handles missing values within each group's calculation.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>You would repeat the `aggregate()` command, changing `FUN` to `median` and `sd` for those respective statistics.</p>
            <pre><code>
aggregate(final_exam_score ~ used_study_support_services, data = data, FUN = median, na.rm = TRUE)
aggregate(final_exam_score ~ used_study_support_services, data = data, FUN = sd, na.rm = TRUE)
            </code></pre>
            <p>Example Output (for `aggregate` means):</p>
            <pre><code>
  used_study_support_services final_exam_score
1                          No         72.33333
2                         Yes         76.90385
            </code></pre>
            <li>To create grouped box plots, `boxplot()` can directly handle this with a formula.</li>
            <pre><code>
boxplot(final_exam_score ~ used_study_support_services, data = data,
        main = "Final Exam Scores by Study Support Service Usage",
        xlab = "Used Study Support Services",
        ylab = "Final Exam Score",
        col = c("lightpink", "lightcyan"),
        border = "darkgray")
            </code></pre>
            <p>
                This `boxplot()` command uses a formula syntax similar to `aggregate()`.
                <ul>
                    <li>`final_exam_score ~ used_study_support_services` tells `boxplot()` to create separate box plots of `final_exam_score` for each category in `used_study_support_services`.</li>
                    <li>`data = data` specifies the data frame.</li>
                    <li>`main`, `xlab`, `ylab`, `col`, and `border` arguments are used for customizing the plot's appearance, as explained in Section 1.3.</li>
                </ul>
            </p>
            <p>Running this command will generate the grouped box plot in your R Studio "Plots" pane.</p>

        <p>By comparing the statistics and plots for each group, you can identify differences in the central tendency, spread, and shape of the numerical variable's distribution across your defined categories.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comparison of Means/Medians:</strong> Observe if the average exam scores are different for students who used support services compared to those who did not.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparison of Standard Deviations:</strong> Determine if the variability (consistency) in exam scores is different between the two groups. A larger standard deviation suggests more diverse scores within that group.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparison of Skewness/Kurtosis:</strong> Analyze if the shapes of the exam score distributions differ between the 'Yes' and 'No' groups (e.g., is one group's scores more skewed or more peaked?).</li>
            <li><strong>Box Plots:</strong> Visually compare the median lines, the size of the boxes (IQR), and the presence or absence of outliers between the groups. This provides a quick visual summary of potential group differences.</li>
        </ul>

            <h4>Reflection Questions & Tasks:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Based on the grouped descriptive statistics for final exam scores when split by `used_study_support_services`, what is the mean final exam score for students who used support services (76.90) compared to those who did not (72.33)? What initial conclusion can you draw from this difference?</li>
                <li>Examine the standard deviations for both groups: 'Yes' (4.77) and 'No' (5.84). What does this difference imply about the consistency or variability of final exam scores within each group?</li>
                <li>Look closely at the grouped histograms or box plots. Do the distributions of final exam scores appear to have similar shapes (e.g., symmetry, spread, presence of outliers) for both groups, or are there noticeable visual differences that stand out?</li>
                <li><strong>Task:</strong> Conduct a similar analysis. Explore the numerical variable `quiz_score_post`, but this time, split it by the categorical variable `attended_peer_study_group`. Compare the descriptive statistics and plots for students who 'Yes' attended versus 'No' attended. What patterns do you observe regarding their post-quiz scores?</li>

            <h4>Suggested Solutions for Reflection Questions (Part 3):</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>The mean final exam score for students who used study support services is 76.90, which is higher than the mean of 72.33 for students who did not use support services. This suggests that, in this sample, students who utilized study support services tended to achieve higher final exam scores, on average.</li>
                <li>The standard deviation for the 'Yes' group (4.77) is smaller than for the 'No' group (5.84). This implies that final exam scores among students who used study support services were generally **more consistent** (less spread out) compared to those who did not use study support services. The scores in the 'Yes' group were more clustered around their mean.</li>
                <li>For final exam scores split by `used_study_support_services`:
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>'No' Group:</strong> N=48, Mean=72.33, Median=72.00, StdDev=5.84, Min=60, Max=89, Skewness=0.31, Kurtosis=0.31. Mode: [68, 69, 71, 78] (multimodal).</li>
                        <li><strong>'Yes' Group:</strong> N=52, Mean=76.90, Median=76.00, StdDev=4.77, Min=68, Max=87, Skewness=0.20, Kurtosis=-0.56. Mode: [76].</li>
                    </ul>
                    Visually, the box plots will show that the 'Yes' group's distribution is centred at a higher score and its box (IQR) is narrower, indicating less variability. Both distributions appear relatively symmetrical, but the 'Yes' group might appear slightly flatter (more platykurtic) in its histogram, while the 'No' group is slightly more peaked.</li>
                <li><strong>Task Solution (for `quiz_score_post` split by `attended_peer_study_group`):</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>Students who DID NOT attend peer study group ('No' group):</strong> You might find a Mean of post-quiz scores of approximately 68.5 (SD ~7.2).</li>
                        <li><strong>Students who DID attend peer study group ('Yes' group):</strong> You might find a Mean of post-quiz scores of approximately 74.1 (SD ~6.5).</li>
                    </ul>
                    Based on these example numbers, students who attended peer study groups would tend to have a higher average post-quiz score and potentially slightly less variability in their scores compared to those who did not attend. This indicates a positive association between attending peer study groups and post-quiz performance in this sample.

            <h4>Write-Up Template for Grouped Interval/Ratio Variable (Example)</h4>
            <p>To compare final exam performance based on study support service usage, descriptive statistics for final exam scores were computed, split by study support service usage. Students who reported using study support services (N = 52) had a mean final exam score of 76.90 (SD = 4.77), a median of 76.00, and scores ranging from 68 to 87. In contrast, students who did not use study support services (N = 48) had a mean final exam score of 72.33 (SD = 5.84), a median of 72.00, and scores ranging from 60 to 89. This suggests that students utilizing support services achieved, on average, higher and more consistent final exam scores. Further visual inspection of the grouped histograms and box plots provides additional insights into the distributions of scores for both groups. For instance, the 'Yes' group's distribution appears slightly narrower and centred at a higher score, with less variability than the 'No' group. Both distributions were relatively symmetrical, with the 'No' group having a skewness of 0.31 and kurtosis of 0.31, while the 'Yes' group had a skewness of 0.20 and kurtosis of -0.56.</p>
