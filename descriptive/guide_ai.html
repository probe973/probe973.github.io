        <h1>Descriptive Statistics with AI Prompts</h1>
        <p class="subtitle">A Guide to Understanding and Summarising Data using Artificial Intelligence</p>

        <div class="warning-box">
            <h3>Important Warning about AI and Data Analysis:</h3>
            <p>While AI can be a powerful tool for generating insights and assisting with data analysis, it's crucial to understand its limitations. **AI models can make mistakes, "hallucinate" data, or provide incorrect interpretations, especially if the input is unclear, ambiguous, or if it lacks real-world context.**</p>
            <p><strong>Always verify the output of an AI model against your raw data and your understanding of statistical principles.</strong> Treat AI as a helpful assistant, not as a replacement for critical thinking and human oversight in data analysis. The examples in this guide assume you will input real data into the AI entity.</p>
        </div>

        <p>This guide will walk you through the process of obtaining summary statistics and creating relevant graphs for different types of variables by formulating effective prompts for an AI entity. Understanding descriptive statistics is a foundational skill in data analysis, providing essential insights into the characteristics of your dataset.</p>

        <p>Descriptive statistics help us understand the basic features of the data in a study. They provide simple summaries about the sample and the measures, forming the basis of virtually every quantitative analysis.</p>

        <p>Before you begin, **please ensure you have uploaded your <code>omni.csv</code> file to the AI entity** (if your AI platform supports file uploads). If not, you will need to describe your data structure and provide relevant snippets directly in your prompts as demonstrated in the examples. Throughout this guide, we will refer to variables from this dataset to illustrate effective prompting strategies. You will be encouraged to adapt these prompts for your own specific data.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><code>final_exam_score</code>: Represents the numerical score achieved by students on a final exam.</li>
            <li><code>study_hours_per_week</code>: Indicates the number of hours a student reported studying each week.</li>
            <li><code>preferred_study_method</code>: Describes a student's chosen study strategy (e.g., 'Flashcards', 'Summarising', 'Practice Tests').</li>
            <li><code>study_session_group</code>: A categorical variable indicating the type of study session group a student was assigned to (e.g., 'High', 'Medium', 'Low').</li>
            <li><code>used_study_support_services</code>: A categorical variable indicating whether a student utilised study support services (Yes/No).</li>
        </ul>

        <h2>Part 1: Analysing Interval/Ratio Variables with AI</h2>
        <p>Interval/ratio variables are numerical variables where the differences between values are meaningful. For these, we examine measures of central tendency (mean, median, mode) and dispersion (standard deviation, variance, range), along with distribution shape (skewness, kurtosis).</p>

        <h3>1.1 Obtaining Summary Statistics for Interval/Ratio Variables (e.g., final_exam_score)</h3>
        <p>When asking an AI for descriptive statistics, be clear about the variable, its type, and what statistics you need. Refer to your uploaded `omni.csv` file.</p>
        <h4>Example Prompt:</h4>
        <pre><code>
From the `omni.csv` dataset I uploaded, please calculate the mean, median, mode, standard deviation, variance, minimum, maximum, skewness, and kurtosis for the `final_exam_score` variable. Also, provide a brief interpretation of each statistic.
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            **Explanation:** This prompt explicitly states the dataset (`omni.csv`), the variable name (`final_exam_score`), and a comprehensive list of desired statistics. It also asks for an "interpretation," encouraging the AI to provide context for the numbers.
        </p>

        <h3>1.2 Interpreting Summary Statistics for Interval/Ratio Variables (AI Output)</h3>
        <p>Based on a prompt like the one above, an AI might provide output similar to what you would get from statistical software. You would then interpret these just as you would with any other analysis. The AI's explanation can serve as a guide, but always cross-reference with your own knowledge.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Mean:</strong> The average score.</li>
            <li><strong>Median:</strong> The middle score when arranged in order.</li>
            <li><strong>Mode:</strong> The most frequent score(s).</li>
            <li><strong>Standard Deviation:</strong> How spread out the scores are from the mean.</li>
            <li><strong>Variance:</strong> The average of the squared differences from the mean (standard deviation squared).</li>
            <li><strong>Minimum &amp; Maximum:</strong> The lowest and highest scores.</li>
            <li><strong>Skewness:</strong> Indicates if the scores are symmetrically distributed or if they lean to one side (tail). Positive skew means a tail to the right (more lower scores), negative to the left (more higher scores).</li>
            <li><strong>Kurtosis:</strong> Describes the "tailedness" and "peakedness" of the distribution. High kurtosis means more extreme outliers and a sharper peak, low means flatter and fewer outliers.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>1.3 Creating Graphs for Interval/Ratio Variables with AI (Histograms & Box Plots)</h3>
        <p>You can ask AI to describe or even generate code for visualisations. The capability of AIs to provide actual plots varies. Some AI tools, including those integrated into productivity suites (e.g., certain versions of Microsoft Copilot in Office) or dedicated data analysis AI interfaces, can directly generate and display the visual plots within their output.</p>

        <h4>Example Prompt for AIs that Directly Render Plots:</h4>
        <pre><code>
Using the `omni.csv` dataset, please generate a histogram and a box plot for the `final_exam_score` variable. Ensure appropriate labels and titles are included in the plots.
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            **Explanation:** This prompt directly asks the AI to generate the visual plots. Use this type of prompt if your AI tool is known to have integrated plotting capabilities.
        </p>

        <p>For AI models that are not capable of rendering the visual plots (e.g., Gemini), you can ask for Python or R code to generate these plots yourself.</p>

        <h4>Example Prompt for AIs that Provide Plotting Code:</h4>
        <pre><code>
Using the `omni.csv` dataset, please describe what a histogram of the `final_exam_score` variable would look like and what it would tell me about the data's distribution. Also, describe what a box plot would show, focusing on central tendency, spread, and any potential outliers. Additionally, provide Python code to generate these plots from the `final_exam_score` column in a pandas DataFrame.
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            **Explanation:** This prompt asks for both a description of what the plots reveal and, crucially, asks for executable code. You can then copy and run this code in a separate programming environment like Google Colab, Jupyter Notebooks, or a Python/R IDE to generate the actual visualisations yourself. This allows you to verify the AI's descriptive interpretation and engage in hands-on coding. It also specifies the format of the data (pandas DataFrame) for clarity if you intend to run the code.
        </p>

        <h3>1.4 Interpreting Graphs for Interval/Ratio Variables (AI Output & Your Visualisation)</h3>
        <p>Once you generate the plots using the AI's code (or if the AI gives a textual description of the plot):</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Histogram:</strong> Visually assess the shape of the distribution, showing where values are concentrated, identifying peaks (modes), gaps, and overall symmetry or skewness.</li>
            <li><strong>Box Plot:</strong> Identify the median line (middle of the box), the range of the central 50% of data (the box itself), the extent of the "whiskers" (typical data range), and any individual points beyond the whiskers (potential outliers).</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="reflection-question">
            <h4>Reflection Questions & Tasks:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>Ask the AI to calculate the mean and median for `study_hours_per_week` from the `omni.csv` file. Based on its output, explain what the difference suggests about the distribution's shape.</li>
                <li>Ask the AI to describe what a histogram and a box plot of the `study_hours_per_week` variable from `omni.csv` would look like, noting any potential skewness or outliers.</li>
                <li><strong>Task:</strong> Use a prompt to ask the AI to summarise the `study_hours_per_week` variable from `omni.csv`. Then, based on its output, describe the distribution's shape, spread, and central tendency in your own words.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-section">
            <h4>Suggested Solutions for Reflection Questions (Part 1):</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>If the mean is notably higher than the median for `study_hours_per_week`, the AI should explain that this suggests a **positive skew** in the distribution, meaning there's a tail extending to higher values (e.g., a few students studying very long hours pulling the mean up). If the mean is lower than the median, it indicates **negative skew**.</li>
                <li>For `study_hours_per_week`, the AI should describe a histogram that might show a slight positive skew (more bars on the left, with a tail to the right) and a box plot that might show a few individual points beyond the upper whisker, indicating outliers of very high study hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Task Solution Example:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>AI Output (example for `study_hours_per_week`):</strong> Mean = 19.28, Median = 18.50, SD = 7.39, Min = 0.0, Max = 40.0. Skewness = 0.38 (positive), Kurtosis = 0.07.</li>
                        <li><strong>Your Interpretation:</strong> The average study hours are about 19.28 per week, with a median of 18.50. The standard deviation of 7.39 indicates considerable variability in reported study hours among students. The slight positive skewness suggests that most students study fewer hours, but there are some who study significantly more hours, pulling the mean upwards.</li>
                    </ul>
                </li>
            </ol>

        <h2>Part 2: Analysing Categorical Variables with AI</h2>
        <p>For categorical variables, we focus on frequencies and proportions, as mathematical operations like means are not meaningful. Refer to your uploaded `omni.csv` file and the variable names.</p>

        <h3>2.1 Obtaining Frequency Tables for Categorical Variables (e.g., preferred_study_method)</h3>
        <p>When asking AI for frequencies, refer to the categorical variable in your uploaded file.</p>
        <h4>Example Prompt:</h4>
        <pre><code>
From the `omni.csv` dataset, please create a frequency table showing the count and percentage for each category of the `preferred_study_method` variable.
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            **Explanation:** This prompt clearly refers to the dataset and the specific categorical variable. It explicitly asks for both counts and percentages in the frequency table.
        </p>

        <h3>2.2 Interpreting Frequency Tables for Categorical Variables (AI Output)</h3>
        <p>The AI's output should list each category with its corresponding frequency (count) and percentage. You would interpret this similar to software output:</p>
        <table>
            <thead>
                <tr>
                    <th>Preferred Study Method</th>
                    <th>Count</th>
                    <th>% of Total</th>
                </tr>
            </thead>
            <tbody>
                <tr>
                    <td>Flashcards</td>
                    <td>36</td>
                    <td>36.0%</td>
                </tr>
                <tr>

                    <td>31</td>
                    <td>31.0%</td>
                </tr>
            </tbody>
        </table>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Count:</strong> The number of instances for each category.</li>
            <li><strong>%:</strong> The proportion of the total sample that falls into each category.</li>
        </ul>

        <h3>2.3 Creating Graphs for Categorical Variables with AI (Bar Charts & Pie Charts)</h3>
        <p>You can ask the AI to describe these charts or generate code for them, similar to numerical variables. The capability of AIs to provide actual plots varies. Some AI tools, including those integrated into productivity suites (e.g., certain versions of Microsoft Copilot in Office) or dedicated data analysis AI interfaces, can directly generate and display the visual plots within their output.</p>

        <h4>Example Prompt for AIs that Directly Render Plots:</h4>
        <pre><code>
Using the `omni.csv` dataset, please generate a bar chart and a pie chart for the `preferred_study_method` variable. Ensure appropriate labels and titles are included in the plots.
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            **Explanation:** This prompt directly asks the AI to generate the visual plots. Use this type of prompt if your AI tool is known to have integrated plotting capabilities.
        </p>

        <p>For AI models that are not capable of rendering the visual plots (e.g., Gemini), you can ask for Python or R code to generate these plots yourself.</p>

        <h4>Example Prompt for AIs that Provide Plotting Code:</h4>
        <pre><code>
Using the `omni.csv` dataset, please describe what a bar chart for the `preferred_study_method` variable would look like, emphasising which method is most popular. Also, describe what a pie chart would convey for the same variable. Additionally, provide Python code to generate both a bar chart and a pie chart from the `preferred_study_method` column in a pandas DataFrame.
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            **Explanation:** This prompt reiterates the dataset and variable name, and explicitly asks for descriptions and code for both types of charts, specifying what visual insights are expected. You can then copy and run this code in a separate programming environment like Google Colab, Jupyter Notebooks, or a Python/R IDE to generate the actual visualisations yourself. This allows you to verify the AI's descriptive interpretation and engage in hands-on coding.

        <ul>
            <li><strong>Bar Chart:</strong> Look for the tallest bar to identify the most frequent category. Compare bar heights to understand relative popularity.</li>
            <li><strong>Pie Chart:</strong> Observe the size of each slice relative to the whole circle. Larger slices represent larger proportions. Best for showing "parts of a whole."</li>

            <h4>Reflection Questions & Tasks:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>From the `omni.csv` dataset, ask the AI to create a frequency table for `study_session_group` and tell you which group is the largest and smallest in terms of percentage.</li>
                <li>Ask the AI to explain why a bar chart is generally preferred over a pie chart for comparing categories, especially when the percentages are similar or there are many categories.</li>
                <li><strong>Task:</strong> Ask the AI to summarise a categorical variable with at least four categories from your `omni.csv` dataset. Then, based on its output, describe the distribution in terms of percentages across these categories.</li>

            <h4>Suggested Solutions for Reflection Questions (Part 2):</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>AI should produce a frequency table for `study_session_group` and correctly identify the largest and smallest groups based on their percentages.</li>
                <li>AI should explain that bar charts make it easier for the human eye to compare lengths (bar heights) accurately than to compare areas or angles (pie slices), especially when values are close or numerous.</li>

                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>AI Generated Data:</strong> (This would be based on your `omni.csv` `study_session_group` variable)</li>
                        <li><strong>AI Output (example based on `omni.csv`):</strong>
                            <pre><code>
Category    | Count | Percentage
------------|-------|-----------
Medium      | 36    | 36.0%
Low         | 33    | 33.0%
High        | 31    | 31.0%
                            </code></pre>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Your Interpretation:</strong> The "Medium" study session group is the most frequent, making up 36% of the data, with "Low" and "High" groups having slightly smaller but still substantial proportions.</li>

        <h2>Part 3: Descriptive Statistics by Groups with AI</h2>
        <p>When you want to compare a numerical variable across different groups of a categorical variable, you need to clearly structure your prompt to define both the numerical variable and the grouping variable from your uploaded `omni.csv` file.</p>

        <h3>3.1 Analysing Interval/Ratio Variable by a Categorical Factor (e.g., final exam scores by used_study_support_services)</h3>
        <p>Provide the AI with clear instructions to analyse data from the specified columns in your uploaded file.</p>
        <h4>Example Prompt:</h4>
        <pre><code>
Using the `omni.csv` dataset, please calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation for the `final_exam_score` variable, grouped by the `used_study_support_services` variable. Then, briefly compare and interpret the differences between the 'Yes' and 'No' groups based on these statistics.
        </code></pre>
        <p>
            **Explanation:** This prompt explicitly refers to the dataset and both the numerical and categorical variables. It clearly asks for grouped statistics and a comparative interpretation.
        </p>

        <h3>3.2 Interpreting Grouped Descriptive Statistics (AI Output)</h3>
        <p>The AI should provide separate statistics for each group, allowing for direct comparison. This output will be similar to what you would find in statistical software.</p>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>Comparison of Means/Medians:</strong> Look for differences in average scores between groups.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparison of Standard Deviations:</strong> Assess if one group's scores are more consistent (smaller SD) or more varied (larger SD) than another.</li>
            <li><strong>Comparison of Skewness/Kurtosis:</strong> Analyse if the shapes of the exam score distributions differ between the 'Yes' and 'No' groups (e.g., is one group's scores more skewed or more peaked?).</li>
            <li><strong>Box Plots:</strong> Visually compare the median lines, the size of the boxes (IQR), and the presence or absence of outliers between the groups. This provides a quick visual summary of potential group differences.</li>
        </ul>

        <div class="reflection-question">
            <h4>Reflection Questions & Tasks:</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>From the `omni.csv` dataset, ask the AI to provide the means and standard deviations for `quiz_score_post` grouped by `attended_peer_study_group`. Describe what these differences might suggest.</li>
                <li>Ask the AI to explain why analysing data by groups is important in research and what kind of insights it can provide that a single overall summary might miss.</li>
                <li><strong>Task:</strong> From your `omni.csv` dataset, ask the AI to generate a grouped descriptive analysis for a numerical variable and a binary categorical variable. Ask it to highlight the most significant difference it finds between the groups and explain what that implies.</li>
            </ol>
        </div>

        <div class="solution-section">
            <h4>Suggested Solutions for Reflection Questions (Part 3):</h4>
            <ol>
                <li>If the mean is notably higher than the median for `study_hours_per_week`, the AI should explain that this suggests a **positive skew** in the distribution, meaning there's a tail extending to higher values (e.g., a few students studying very long hours pulling the mean up). If the mean is lower than the median, it indicates **negative skew**.</li>
                <li>For `study_hours_per_week`, the AI should describe a histogram that might show a slight positive skew (more bars on the left, with a tail to the right) and a box plot that might show a few individual points beyond the upper whisker, indicating outliers of very high study hours.</li>
                <li><strong>Task Solution Example:</strong>
                    <ul>
                        <li><strong>AI Output (example for `omni.csv`):</strong>
                            <pre><code>
For final_exam_score grouped by used_study_support_services:
Used Study Support Services | Mean  | Std. Dev.
----------------------------|-------|----------
No                          | 72.33 | 5.84
Yes                         | 76.90 | 4.77
                            </code></pre>
                        </li>
                        <li><strong>Your Interpretation:</strong> The AI highlights that students who used study support services ('Yes' group) had a notably higher average final exam score (76.90) compared to those who did not (72.33). Additionally, the 'Yes' group shows less variability in scores (SD = 4.77) compared to the 'No' group (SD = 5.84), implying their scores were more consistent. This suggests a positive association between using study support services and both higher performance and consistency in final exam scores within this dataset.</li>

        <h2>Part 4: Best Practices for Prompting AI for Data Analysis</h2>
        <p>To get the most accurate and useful results from an AI when performing descriptive statistics, follow these best practices:</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Be Specific and Clear:</strong> Explicitly state what you want. Instead of "Summarise this data," say "From the `omni.csv` dataset, calculate the mean, median, and standard deviation for the `final_exam_score` variable."</li>
            <li><strong>Provide Context:</strong> Tell the AI about the type of variables if it's not self-evident from the data (e.g., "The `final_exam_score` is a numerical variable," or "The `preferred_study_method` is a categorical variable.").</li>
            <li><strong>Ensure Data Access:</strong> Clearly state that the data is from an uploaded file (e.g., "Using the `omni.csv` dataset..."). If your AI platform does not support file uploads, you must paste relevant data subsets directly into the prompt.</li>
            <li><strong>Ask for Interpretation:</strong> Don't just ask for numbers; ask the AI to "interpret" or "explain the implications" of the results. This pushes the AI to provide qualitative insights.</li>
            <li><strong>Request Specific Output Format:</strong> Ask for results in a table, a specific format (e.g., "provide the output in a markdown table"), or as executable code (e.g., "provide Python code for the plots from a pandas DataFrame").</li>
            <li><strong>Iterate and Refine:</strong> If the initial response isn't what you need, ask follow-up questions. "Can you explain the skewness in simpler terms?" or "Now, compare the results for the 'Yes' and 'No' groups more directly."</li>
            <li><strong>Cross-Verify:</strong> This is the most critical step. Always manually check the AI's calculations, compare its interpretations to your own knowledge, and run any generated code to visually inspect plots. Do not blindly trust AI output.</li>
        </ol>

        <hr>

        <h2>Conclusion</h2>
        <p>You have now explored fundamental techniques for formulating prompts to obtain and interpret descriptive statistics and their corresponding visualisations using an AI entity. By working with numerical and categorical variables, both independently and by splitting your data into groups, you've gained valuable skills for summarising and understanding the core characteristics of your datasets.</p>
        <p>Remember that AI is a tool to augment your analytical capabilities, not replace them. Continue practising effective prompting and, most importantly, always apply critical thinking and verification to the AI's output to ensure accuracy and derive meaningful insights from your data.</p>
