        <h1>AI Prompts Guide</h1>
        <p>Welcome to this guide on reliability analysis, specifically tailored for how you can achieve these analyses using AI chatbots. When we measure something, like 'satisfaction' or 'anxiety', we often use multiple questions or 'items' to capture the full concept. Reliability analysis helps us understand if these items consistently measure the same thing.</p>

        <h2>What is Reliability?</h2>
        <p>Imagine using a bathroom scale. If you step on it multiple times in a row and get wildly different readings each time, you'd consider it unreliable. In research, reliability refers to the consistency of a measure. If a questionnaire is reliable, it should produce similar results under consistent conditions.</p>

        <h3>Introducing Cronbach's Alpha</h3>
        <p>One of the most common ways to assess the internal consistency reliability of a scale is through <strong>Cronbach's Alpha (&alpha;)</strong>. It's a single number that ranges from 0 to 1, indicating how closely related a set of items are as a group. Think of it as the average correlation of all possible split-halves of a test.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>A higher Cronbach's Alpha generally indicates greater internal consistency.</li>
            <li><strong>Interpretation Guidelines (general):</strong>
                <ul>
                    <li>&alpha; &ge; 0.9: Excellent</li>
                    <li>0.8 &le; &alpha; &lt; 0.9: Good</li>
                    <li>0.7 &le; &alpha; &lt; 0.8: Acceptable</li>
                    <li>0.6 &le; &alpha; &lt; 0.7: Questionable</li>
                    <li>0.5 &le; &alpha; &lt; 0.6: Poor</li>
                    <li>&alpha; &lt; 0.5: Unacceptable</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <p>It's important to note that while a high alpha is desirable, it doesn't necessarily mean the scale is measuring what it's supposed to measure (that's validity). It just means the items are consistent with each other.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3>Data Setup: The Omni Dataset</h3>
        <p>This guide uses the omni dataset. If you need help loading this data, please refer to the loading data guides. Remember to upload your dataset to the AI chatbot before asking questions about it.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3>When Responses Might Need to be Reverse Scored</h3>
        <p>Sometimes, not all questions in a scale are phrased in the same direction. For example, in a satisfaction survey, most questions might ask about positive aspects of satisfaction ("I am happy with...", "I am pleased with..."), but one question might be phrased negatively ("I am dissatisfied with..."). If a high score on the 'satisfied' questions indicates high satisfaction, then a high score on the 'dissatisfied' question would indicate <em>low</em> satisfaction.</p>
        <p>To ensure all items contribute consistently to the overall score, we need to <strong>reverse score</strong> the negatively phrased items. This means transforming the response so that a high score on that item now also indicates high satisfaction.</p>

        <h4>How to Ask AI to Identify Items for Reverse Scoring:</h4>
        <p>You can ask the AI to check correlations or describe item phrasing to identify potential candidates for reverse scoring.</p>
        <ol>
            <li><strong>Check wording:</strong>
                <div class="prompt-example">Examine the variables 'satisfaction_q1', 'satisfaction_q2', 'satisfaction_q3', 'satisfaction_q4', 'satisfaction_q5' in the dataset. Are any of these phrased negatively or in an opposite direction compared to the others, suggesting they might need reverse scoring?</div>
            </li>
            <li><strong>Check correlations (AI will interpret):</strong>
                <div class="prompt-example">Calculate the correlation matrix for 'satisfaction_q1', 'satisfaction_q2', 'satisfaction_q3', 'satisfaction_q4', 'satisfaction_q5'. Do any items show negative correlations with the others that might indicate they need reverse scoring?</div>
            </li>
        </ol>
        <p>Based on the <code>omni.csv</code> dataset, the <code>satisfaction_q</code> variables all show positive correlations with each other (e.g., satisfaction_q1 and satisfaction_q2 correlate at ~0.88; satisfaction_q3 and satisfaction_q4 at ~0.91). This suggests that all satisfaction questions are phrased in a consistent direction and <strong>do not require reverse scoring</strong> for this specific dataset.</p>

        <h4>How to Ask AI to Perform Reverse Scoring (if needed):</h4>
        <p>If your AI determines that an item needs reverse scoring (e.g., for a 1-5 Likert scale, where 1 becomes 5, 2 becomes 4, etc.):</p>
        <div class="prompt-example">Create a new variable called 'satisfaction_q3_rev' by reverse scoring 'satisfaction_q3' based on a 5-point Likert scale (where 1 becomes 5, 2 becomes 4, etc.).</div>
        <p><strong>Expected AI Output:</strong> The AI will confirm it has created the new variable and may show you a sample of the transformed values or basic descriptives for the new variable. The AI might also provide the Python code it used to perform the transformation, which you could then run in a local environment if you prefer.</p>

        <hr>

        <h3>AI How-To: Reliability Analysis (Cronbach's Alpha)</h3>
        <p>AI chatbots can perform reliability analysis very efficiently once your data is loaded.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>The Question to Ask the AI (Prompt):</h4>
                <p>Clearly specify the items that form your scale. You can also request specific additional information like "alpha if item deleted" values.</p>
                <div class="prompt-example">Calculate Cronbach's Alpha for the variables 'satisfaction_q1', 'satisfaction_q2', 'satisfaction_q3', 'satisfaction_q4', 'satisfaction_q5' in the dataset. Include the 'alpha if item deleted' values.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Understanding the Expected AI Output:</h4>
                <p>The AI will likely present the results in a clear, summarized format, similar to statistical software output. Key elements to look for:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li><strong>Overall Cronbach's Alpha Value:</strong> This is the main reliability coefficient for your scale.</li>
                    <li><strong>Number of Items:</strong> The total count of variables included in the calculation.</li>
                    <li><strong>"Alpha if Item Deleted" Table:</strong> This table is crucial. For each item in your scale, it shows what the overall Cronbach's Alpha would be if that specific item were removed from the scale.</li>
                </ul>
                <p>Example of how the AI might present the output for the <code>satisfaction_q</code> items:</p>
                <pre><code>--- Reliability Analysis Results ---
Scale: Satisfaction Questionnaire
Overall Cronbach's Alpha: 0.960
Number of Items: 5

Item Statistics (Alpha if Item Deleted):
------------------------------------------------
Item                Alpha if Item Deleted
------------------------------------------------
satisfaction_q1     0.955
satisfaction_q2     0.957
satisfaction_q3     0.958
satisfaction_q4     0.956
satisfaction_q5     0.955
------------------------------------------------</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Interpretation of the Output:</h4>
                <p>For your <code>satisfaction_q</code> items, the Cronbach's Alpha is approximately <strong>0.960</strong>. Based on the general guidelines:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>This indicates **excellent internal consistency**. This means the five satisfaction questions are highly consistent and reliably measure the same underlying construct of satisfaction.</li>
                    <li>Review the "Alpha if Item Deleted" table: In this example, all values are slightly lower than or very close to the overall alpha (0.960). This indicates that no single item's removal would substantially improve the scale's reliability; rather, all items are contributing positively to the high internal consistency. If an item showed a much higher "Alpha if Item Deleted" value, it would suggest that item might be problematic and could be considered for removal (if theoretically justified).</li>
                </ul>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="reflection-box">
            <h4>Reflection Question:</h4>
            <p>If your Cronbach's Alpha was very low (e.g., 0.2), what might that suggest about the set of items you used to measure satisfaction, and how would you use the "Alpha if Item Deleted" information from the AI?</p>
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h3>AI How-To: Create a Combined Scale Score</h3>
        <p>Once you've established the reliability of your scale, you often want to create a single 'combined' or 'total' score for each participant. This score represents their overall standing on the construct being measured (e.g., overall satisfaction).</p>
        <p>You have two main options for creating this combined score: <strong>summing</strong> the item scores or <strong>averaging</strong> them. Averaging is generally recommended as it keeps the score on the original scale metric (e.g., 1-5 for a Likert scale), which can be easier to interpret and compare across different scales or studies.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>The Question to Ask the AI (Prompt):</h4>
                <p>To create a combined score by averaging the item scores:</p>
                <div class="prompt-example">Create a new variable called 'combined_satisfaction' by averaging the values of 'satisfaction_q1', 'satisfaction_q2', 'satisfaction_q3', 'satisfaction_q4', 'satisfaction_q5'. Please ensure missing values are handled appropriately (e.g., mean calculated from available items if some are missing).</div>
                <p><strong>Note for Beginners:</strong> Most AI tools, especially when generating code, will default to methods that handle missing values appropriately (e.g., `np.nanmean` in Python), calculating the mean based on available items. You can explicitly ask for this behavior.</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Understanding the Expected AI Output:</h4>
                <p>The AI will confirm the creation of the new variable, often providing a snippet of the dataset with the new column or some basic descriptive statistics for the newly created combined score.</p>
                <p>Example: "A new variable `combined_satisfaction` has been created. Here are the first few rows showing the new variable:" (followed by a small data table).</p>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Interpretation:</h4>
                <p>The new `combined_satisfaction` variable represents each participant's average score across the satisfaction items. For a 1-5 Likert scale, this new variable will also range from 1 to 5, where higher values indicate greater satisfaction.</p>
            </li>
        </ul>
        <div class="reflection-box">
            <h4>Reflection Question:</h4>
            <p>What would be an advantage of using the mean (average) for your combined scale score compared to using the sum, especially when comparing scores across different scales or studies?</p>
        </div>

        <hr>

        <h3>AI How-To: Generate Summary Statistics for the Combined Satisfaction Score</h3>
        <p>Once you have your combined scale, it's good practice to generate some summary statistics to understand its distribution. This includes measures like the mean, median, standard deviation, and range.</p>
        <ul>
            <li>
                <h4>The Question to Ask the AI (Prompt):</h4>
                <p>Request the specific descriptive statistics you need for your newly created combined score.</p>
                <div class="prompt-example">Provide summary statistics (mean, median, standard deviation, minimum, maximum, quartiles) for the 'combined_satisfaction' variable.</div>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Understanding the Expected AI Output:</h4>
                <p>The AI will present a table or list of the requested descriptive statistics for your combined score.</p>
                <p>Example of output for your `combined_satisfaction` score:</p>
                <pre><code>--- Descriptives for combined_satisfaction ---
Count:              100
Mean:               3.04
Median:             3.10
Standard Deviation: 1.40
Minimum:            1.00
25th Percentile:    1.60
75th Percentile:    4.45
Maximum:            5.00</code></pre>
            </li>
            <li>
                <h4>Interpretation:</h4>
                <p>These statistics give you a good overview of your participants' overall satisfaction levels:</p>
                <ul>
                    <li>The **Mean** (3.04) indicates the average satisfaction score.</li>
                    <li>The **Median** (3.10) indicates the middle score when all scores are ordered.</li>
                    <li>The **Standard Deviation** (1.40) tells you how spread out the scores are from the mean.</li>
                    <li>The **Minimum** (1.00) and **Maximum** (5.00) show the full range of scores observed.</li>
                    <li>The **Quartiles** (25th and 75th percentiles) provide insight into the distribution of scores, indicating where the lower and upper quarters of the data lie.</li>
                </ul>
            </li>

        <h3>How to Write-Up Reliability Results</h3>
        <p>When you're writing up your research, it's crucial to clearly report the reliability of your measures. Here's a template for how you can write up the results for Cronbach's Alpha:</p>
        <div class="writeup-box">
            <h4>Example Write-Up:</h4>
            <p>"The internal consistency reliability of the five-item satisfaction scale was assessed using Cronbach's Alpha. The analysis revealed excellent internal consistency, with a Cronbach's Alpha of &alpha; = 0.96. This indicates that the five items consistently measure the same underlying construct of satisfaction. Given the high internal consistency, the five items were averaged to create a single 'combined satisfaction' score for subsequent analyses."</p>
        </div>
        <h4>Key elements to include:</h4>
        <ul>
            <li><strong>What was assessed:</strong> Clearly state the scale or measure whose reliability was assessed.</li>
            <li><strong>Method:</strong> Specify that Cronbach's Alpha was used.</li>
            <li><strong>Result:</strong> Report the exact Cronbach's Alpha value.</li>
            <li><strong>Interpretation:</strong> Briefly interpret what the alpha value means in the context of your scale (e.g., excellent, good, acceptable).</li>
            <li><strong>Action taken:</strong> If a combined score was created, mention how it was done (e.g., averaged, summed).</li>
        </ul>
